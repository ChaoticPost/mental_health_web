"Looking for some supportHi all

Ive been feeling really down lately, ive suffered from mental health problems since childhood, my life has always been a fuck up, thanks to a useless mother and a shitty life, i have achieved nothing and i cant even focus on work, i have worked twice in my life and both ended horribly, after that the doctors got involved and got me help related to sickness benefits, my doctor is SUPERB he has always been by my side and i honestly feel like hes a friend not a doctor. I am now on disability benefit and out of work sickness benefit (not sure if you have such things in the US) 

My main mental health issue is depression but the OCD is the worst bit, its a fucking night mare. I keep getting obsessional thoughts about my dad passing away and about how as soon as it happens i will have to kill myself, it started about 18 months ago but in the last 3-5 months, my mind has come up with serious in detail plans, deep down i really dont want to, but im so scared of what happens when my dad passes away, hes not ill or close to passing, hes in his 70's but hes probably healthier than i am, seriously hes not a 70 year you would imagine, he walks miles, plays on his PlayStation, the lot! but hes the only family i have and he cares for me with my issues (cooking, washing, medication, etc)

"I don't want my life anymore.Like I wish I could just transfer my years of life to someone who would do something with it instead of me. I've waisted my life. My ex used to scream in my face how I am nothing and I've done nothing with my life but I honestly was at least trying before him. He hurt me in so many ways and then just became a tinder patrolling fuck boy after we broke up. His birthday was this week and coupled with Valentine's Day I am really struggling with loneliness and depression. 
I want to go on his page and see all of our mutual friends who wished him happy birthday so I can delete them out of my life forever. If they don't want to believe he abused me I don't want them to be a part of my life. But I have been able to refrain from letting my pain act out in any way. I haven't had a steady job in years and barely get enough freelance to survive. It destroys my self esteem worse than he or my parents did, and that's saying a lot. I used to really be confident and like myself but now I just find everything and everyone so exhausting and overwhelming that I just wish I could die. I think about it a lot. I already tried to poison myself last year when he was telling me I was telling me I was disgusting and a whore and meeting up with outer girls and lying to me about it. I feel isolated after learning that he and my parents are narcissistic abusers and I have no one. ",suicidal,high

"Just needed to get this off of my chest... I will be referring to the girl as “she” throughout this to keep that info private.

She was my best friend from kindergarten all the way until 6th grade when I moved. We never left eachothers side. We played with eachother everyday during recess. We had so many stupid jokes and acted like dumbasses all the time. It was great. The thing is that i’ve always had a crush on her. Every year I was there I have liked her. Why wouldn’t I? She is absolutely perfect for me. She is beautiful, funny, smart, caring, and willing to act like a dumbass with me. We even have the same sense of humor, which is rare. She made moving away a lot harder for me. The only positive in moving away from her is that I would lose feelings and stop chasing her. Unfortunately, I compared every girl at my new school to her and it was impossible for them to even stand a chance at being better than her. She was just too great. It was very long and hard (that’s what she said), but eventually I lost feelings for her. I didn’t feel the way I did for her until freshman year came. That is when I saw her again at a homecoming football game. The first time seeing her again and talking to her made all of those feelings come rushing back to me. I was back where I started. I heard her mention she didn’t have a date to homecoming and so I thought I would be the one to take her. So I asked her if she would be my homecoming date and she said yes! I was shocked and also the happiest I’ve been in my life. I couldn’t believe the girl who I’ve liked forever was going to homecoming with me. I was pumped. I bragged to all of my friends that I had the perfect homecoming date and I was ready to go. Unfortunately, the timing could not have been worse. The weekend of homecoming I flew to Seattle to go to a Seahawks game. We had planned this before hand and I forgot all about it. So that means that I couldn’t go to homecoming with her. I was devastated. I cried and cried like a little baby for like a week over this. Easily the worst thing to happen to me. So after that whole mess, I went on with my life with her constantly in my head. I just couldn’t shake her from my mind. That’s how things would be all the way to today. After sophomore year, I moved back to my old school. I figured that I should catch up with all of my old friends before I see them again. Of course the first person I wanted to talk to was her and that’s exactly what I did. I haven’t talked to her since the homecoming thing so I was pretty scared. I did anyways and of course I talked about homecoming. I said I felt bad and I was really excited to go with her. She said she was also hyped to go with me and she told people that I was going with her. That made me happy to hear. I asked her if we could have a do-over and go to homecoming this year together. She said yes again! I couldn’t believe it. There was no way I was gonna mess this one up. Not again. We talked a lot more about god knows what and the memories that we made along the way. We both agreed that we missed acting like dumbasses together and we both wanted to be close like we used to. She told me she had a crush on me every year that I was there and that shocked me. I was in disbelief that she liked me every year that I liked her. Everything was going perfectly. That was until she suddenly stopped talking to me. I was confused and scared. I didn’t know if it was something I said or what, but either way I was worried. I asked her what was wrong and she told me that her boyfriend didn’t want her talking to me. Her boyfriend huh? I had no idea she had a boyfriend. I was understanding, but still confused. If she had a boyfriend then why did she say we could go to homecoming together this year and why would she tell me that she has always liked me? I was sad, but also a tiny bit proud. I made myself seem like a threat to her boyfriend. Her boyfriend doesn’t know me, so for him to not want her talking to me must mean that she was talking about me to him or that he was scared. Either one makes me feel better. I just didn’t want it to be my fault. So we said our goodbyes and said we’ll talk to eachother when the time is right. After about two or three weeks, I finally had another opportunity to talk to her because it was her birthday. Everybody was gonna be talking to her on her birthday. So I wrote a sweet little message to her and said happy birthday. 
My goal wasn’t to make her leave her boyfriend and go for me, but to make her think that it was sweet and remind her of all of the great times we shared. Luckily, that did the trick. She said it was very sweet and that she misses all of the times we used to have. She also said she wants to be become as close as we used to be and missed having people like that in her life. We then talked a little more about some other stuff and I wanted to make sure that her boyfriend wouldn’t get mad at her for me texting her and she said probably not, but we shouldn’t continue because he checks her phone and he doesn’t even want us being friends. I asked her how we would become as close as we were if he didn’t want us to be friends. She said that we will be friends when school starts no matter what he says. This was a very good sign for me because this means that she is willing not to listen to him to be closer with me. So I told her I was excited for school to start and that I couldn’t wait to see her again. She said the same to me and we said goodbye again. It is kinda sad that we had to stop talking, but at the same time I know that if she breaks up with him, then I have a pretty good shot. I could actually get the girl after all these years of chasing her. We just had to play the waiting game. That’s exactly what i’m doing now. I’m hoping that the same thing will happen to her that happened to me when we see eachother at school again. I hope those feelings will all come back to her like they did to me. I know it’s wrong for me to want this, but can you blame me? She’s the most perfect person in the world and I’m not gonna just let her get away. I am gonna take my shot when the time comes. And when I finally get her, nothing is gonna ruin it for us, we will be unstoppable. Thank you for coming to my TED Talk.",normal,low
"I'm probably getting thereTL;DR: My depression to go crippling levels after I finished university, about 2.5 years ago. Now my life is pushing me towards the edge, work to be more specific. 

I'm just tired of convincing people I'm not dumb basically. There's this one manager who keeps belittling my previous experience (basically I was an enterprise PHP engineer, now I'm an cloud java engineer, I never was a codemonkey) and its been going on for a year now almost. I even had an episode where I introduced a feature that was not yet needed and he laughed at me for overengineering things, in the end we ended up realizing we actually need it and I was right to make it. Its basically like that all the time - I go above and beyond, get laughed at and then we see that it was actually the right decision. Maybe the last part is not always, but I'm fairly sure I do pretty good engineering because my systems just work and my code is not bad. I do my best anyways, maybe I really am a shitty engineer though, who knows. 

Because I'm so depressed that there's literally nothing else in my life than work, I've started to become more depressed because of that situation at work. I've been drinking but recently got it under control. But after today I'm just not sure anymore. I'm just tired of fighting, its not healthy.

My whole life has been like that, someone picks on me all the time, but I fight back with politeness and stellar performance. It helped me in the past - i had scumbag professors in university and all I did was just again stellar work and they just stopped bullying me after they saw that I'm not a lazy idiot. Now it doesn't seem to work. 

I'm just asking myself whether I want to live this life if its gonna be like this my whole life. Its like the only things ahead of me is endless suffering and bullying. Come to think of it, maybe its what life is for most of people out there. Someone always bullies you. Whats funny is that I didn't get bullied in school, had a pretty healthy relationship with my classmates. ",suicidal,high

"you could literally do whatever you want, you know that? and how unfair it is?oh I've tried, believe me I've tried. I *want* to believe in the ideal. Age is just a number, the right girl will see you for who you are, personality is better than looks, fake it till you make it, none of the fun matters as much as looking for the 'one', etc etc. ugh it makes me want to throw up just thinking about it.

I literally feel physically ill. I think the next person that tells me one of the above or says it in earshot I might fucking deck.

Life isn't fair. Life is so the opposite that what is the point to it? Well it's our job to MAKE it fair in an unfair world. To make people happier, safer, brighter. Words I used to live by.

It's too much pressure. I can't. Not when my own needs aren't ever met. I can't do it anymore, any of it. Beautiful people, *stumbling* into things I've worked years for with nothing to show for it. TRIPPING over things a few beers in that I could never in a million years experience. Never had the chance to. Not rich, not smart, not great looking. And because of all that I choked asking out the most amazing girl friend I've had, had a shot last night and blew it - blew it for myself, because who wants this? This balding, 30-something chubby kind fool who thought he had a chance if he just kept trying.

You stupid, stupid bastard. Everyone says you're so nice and you're going to make them so sad for a while with this. You can't but you know someday you will. Tomorrow or 20 years later, you will. You'll do it. You'll do it when you've finally had enough. When you've wasted enough time that you can look back on it and KNOW, rather than suspect, that you'll do nothing but waste it forever. So why not?

Why not?

It would hurt less. You stupid, kind, infinitesimally-small little fool. You are so so tired and tiring, with your bullshit. Life marches on. It's unfair because it has to be. If it were fair the world would lurch to a stop with you but it won't, it can't, because true fairness is an illusion. You work with what you got till you can't, and some people have more closed doors than others.

The world goes on, people survive, Earth continues to rotate, and that's good.

It's good that things aren't missed too bad. Good that pain fades. Maybe not for all, maybe I'll fuck up a sibling or close friend, but I'll have to accept that it's a nice possibility at least.

I can't keep this up forever. And I need it to stop on my terms.

Let me make this one decision. Let me finally follow through. If I can't with someone who I'd want to spend the rest of my life with, let me decide how to end it.

Pull the curtain, M. Pull it and your pressure's finally gone. The play's finally done, you can stop worrying about all the empty seats. PULL IT. Please.",suicidal,high
"My girlfriend has suicidal tendenciesWe've been together for almost a year now. She has had depression for more than ten years now. I am 18 and she's 19. Her mother... I don't know how to explain it, but practically she's a cold bitch that humiliates her and hits her regularly and that doesn't help to treat her depression. 
My girl only has me, she's socially awkward, but so sweet and I love her more than anything else. I always act comprehensive towards her and help her with everything I can, I show my love everyday because I believe she's the one for me.
She's... my sunshine
I don't want them to take my sunshine away
I stopped her from committing suicide twice and lately she was feeling down because the university she wanted rejected her and I haven't known anything from her in quite a long time. Today afternoon she texted me, she only said that she was very grateful with me and that her life may have not been the best, but I helped her to ease a part of it.
I went to her house all paranoic, knocked over and over again for more than half an hour and her mom said she was fine and told me to stay of it and that she didn't want to see me again. I feel devastated, the anguish eats my heart.
The sole idea that my...
my sunshine, my little bubblegum, might be dead by now...
It tears me apart

"Its not that big of a dealI'm considering suicide because I am an absolute failure at life, failed academically, failed socially, failed everything. There's nothing in my life worth salvaging. I think about my family a lot, what it would put them through, and that blocks me from doing it, committing to it. But what harm is it to them really? They will be depressed for a little while and then get over it. My mother is the one I'm worried about the most, she is very weak mentally and wouldn't be able to get over it. But at the same time she has religion, and I think that'd give her strength. I hope so at least. I've considered writing in my suicide note that I asked for forgiveness for what I'm about to do, and I'm not a religious person, but if asking for forgiveness helps my mother deal with it, then I'd definitely do it. My brother and sister would be depressed for a little while but I see them getting through it, they are strong. My dad would be angry at me and rightfully so, but I don't think he'd have a hard time getting over it. I've thought a lot about losing out on happy experiences and all that, but the way I see it, it's better that someone who is happy and fulfilled in life gets to experience those things instead, and I know that those people are out there experiencing those things, so its not so bad. Someone gets to do it, it just won't be me. I have a noose made and a place I want to go to do it, but I don't think its long enough and I'm afraid I'll botch it. There's also a shotgun in the house that I can use, but it'll be really hard to get access to it, since my dad has hidden the key ever since my first attempt. I'm terrified that my family will blame everything and anything and end up getting frustrated and angry at the whole thing, but it's entirely my own fault. I'm entirely to blame.

It's tempting. Oh so fucking tempting. After an agonizing few months I've become aware of how useless, how unloveable I am. I've pushed away the person that I love the most, I've flunked school, I've lost friends, I've fucked up my life. And I have a hard time seeing how it can get better.

 I'm not comfortable posting my entire story here because I know a few redditors IRL, and I wouldn't want them to see it (this is a throwaway account but still, they might recognize some details). I don't want to pollute the internet with my whiny garbage either, not more than necessary at least.

"I need help with family issues TLDR: My dad is trying to rip off my mom from his life and I don't know what to do.

So my parents divorced about seven or eight years ago and everything was fine. My dad and my mom both had partners and both where fine with it. They both live half a km apart. But since my dad's new girlfriend arrived, things have been changing.

First, off, his girlfriend convinced my dad to get a dog for the house, and when we started taking the dog to my mom's house, he one day abruptly decided not to let us do that anymore. He didn't even tell me why concisely. He said some BS about the dog being for the house and whatnot, but I don't buy it. 

Then he told my mom sge was not allowed to go to his mother's house, that she could no longer go to a sportclub (it's a sexist club so she could only go as a wife), and that he would no longer financially support my mom in any way. So my mom told me but she said we were not allowed to tell him that she told us. 

Then one month later it's my sister's BD tomorrow and my sister wanted my mom and my dad to go, but my dad said, and I quote ""I don't want to see you"". He said that in spanish and via chat to my mom, and we didn't see the text, but still. My mom, again, told me this but didn't let me even mention it to my dad.

I want everything to be happy, but I don't know what to do. Help. Please

Edit: My mom did nothing wrong, she never interacted with my dad. He is the one causing the trouble. Also my dad said nothing about the issue whatsoever, not a single thing.",normal,low

"Wondering if anyone else can relate to feeling this way.I want to start by saying I would not technically consider myself suicidal, and I am not really looking for support.  I am more curious to see if anyone else feels the same way that I do, if other people would label me suicidal, or just what other people think in general.  I apologize if this is not the correct sub to be posting in.

I am in my late 20's and I have always had a strange sense of comfort knowing that I would eventually commit suicide, and that I didn't have to stress too much about what is happening today.  Every time I've hit a rough spot in life, my thought process has always been, ""Is this it, or am I strong enough to get over this one?"" and the answer has always been that I am strong enough to carry on.  

I've never had any explicit plans of killing myself, nor have I ever come close to making an attempt.  I just take some kind of morbid solace in knowing that if it ever gets bad enough, I will just check out.

This has not effected how I make my day to day decisions.  I still take care of myself, act responsibly and try to save for retirement. I don't run around thinking I have a get out of jail free card.  I just don't worry about the fact that I don't have one.

The biggest reason I don't do it, is because I wouldn't want to hurt my family.  I am an atheist, so I don't have any religious trepidations about going to hell or anything.

As I said at the top, I don't feel like I need any help, really. I am just interested to see what other people's thoughts are. ",suicidal,high

"I take issue with a lot of what is suggested to help suicidal people1) I do not want to rely heavily on meditating, journaling, and exercise just to make living in the same body as my mind bearable. 

2) I am not looking forward to getting a new job or meeting someone new. In fact, most of the things commonly used to motivate people usually makes me feel more hopeless because I don’t even want those things to begin with. 

3) I don’t have the strength to go on already, why am I being asked to work so hard for a payoff I’m not even interested in achieving? 

4) I have hobbies that should provide me with limitless ideas and goals... but I neglect them because I’ve lost interest. This isn’t just limited to hobbies. 

5) Setting a goal to express kindness and empathy is a tall order... I don’t even express kindness and empathy to myself. 

6) If I’m being honest with myself, my overall contributed value is nearly nothing. I have not made a good employee, student, parent, or any role I’ve assumed. I think my value is best described as just being present to delay the grief caused by physically losing me. Essentially I am already emotionally lost to most of those connected with me.  

7) you matter... but do you really? I am a realist... I’m only worth what people can get out of me. I would be replaced pretty quickly in most of my roles. 

8) I have become the most impatient person I know. I spend most of my days waiting for them to be over. I spend most of my minutes criticizing others for doing things that occupy my headspace.

"What to do when you need to fill a prescription for actionable love and it's always out of stock?I have multiple invisible physical and mental illnesses and disorders that I have been diagnosed with by medical professionals and have had the majority of my life since I was a toddler. I'm currently 27. My entire family has various conditions as well. I wrote out a suicide note for the first time yesterday despite having experienced suicidal ideation very frequently. I told myself it was for the hopeful catharsis. I've reached a point where I feel like I cannot lie to myself anymore. I do not have health insurance. I do not have access to resources. I cannot work or attend school because of my challenges and am fully 100% financially dependent on my parents. 

Everyone in my family has specifically expressed that I am crazy, lying or lazy or all of the above. 

What do you do when talking to anyone does not help because what you need are words that accompany actions from those you love that you will never receive even after directly behind for them?

These could be linked to the JRA, but since I have not been able to get to a rheumatologist since they became an issue - I don't know. All these things together make me feel like I've got every card stacked against me there's a big ass deck that can always be drawn from the keep me down. All of this makes me feel very alone.

"SucksI don't know where to get help. I have a phobia of phones, and really bad social anxiety, but the anxiety can be somewhat worked with though. But then there's the thing that if I booked an appoitment for a therapist, I couldn't afford to take a bus. Walking or going with a bike is not an option, my apartment's literally in the middle of nowhere and I can barely walk around the block.

I come from an abusive home, my parents have abused me emotionally since I was little. They've never hit me or anything, although they have threatened to for sure (they've even threatened to bury my dog alive etc. and told on several occasions that I'm taking poor care of him and that it'd be better for the dog and I'm scared that I am actually as shitty as they tell me I am. I don't want to hurt anyone). The abuse happened pretty much 24/7, and I ended up becoming so scared in the end before moving out that I never even came out of my own room. I have my own apartment now, and I've seen myself getting a lil bit better but it's so hard with no support. I have no one. No friends, maybe a few people I can say hi to on WhatsApp but that's about it. I've lost so many friends in the last couple of years. The last time I saw a friend was at least half a year ago, there's literally nobody in my life.

I'm not in school, don't have job, ironically I'm still supported financially by my parents which scares me. And I can't get into school, because I'm stupid as hell and have already failed and dropped out once.

I guess I just want a hug. I hate having to do everything by myself. Sorry for the weird rants, I'm not even going to spellcheck so blame dyslexia for the bad grammar. ",suicidal,high

"Not sure what the point of living like this would beHi everyone. I was looking up how to end myself peacefully and found this subreddit. I'm 26 and I'm positive that I have to kill myself. Been suffering from untreatable genitourinary pain for the past 7 years. This includes burning when urinating or having an orgasm and just in general. I decided to try a substance called dmso to help with the pain and possibly reverse some of the problem. It turns out that using dmso on your penis is a very risky thing to do. Now my junk is shriveled and hurts worse than ever in my life. Currently lying in bed with an ice pack in my pants as I write this. This is going to be my life now. A week ago I was just depressed and in pain but now I am in excruciating pain and my life is going to be a living hell. I was preparing to transfer colleges in the fall but now I can't go five minutes without shoving ice down my pants. I can't laugh or smile or talk to anyone in anything more than monotone. Sex used to be somewhat out of the question but now I may as well have cut my penis off. What I'm wondering now is whether I can justify forcing myself to fight through excruciating, humiliating pain for the rest of my life and try to get a decent career in spite of being unable to enjoy even a second of being alive or forcing my parents to take care of me until they die followed by barely surviving however I can in intense pain. I want to believe that things could get better, but after looking into it, there seems to be no going back to before the dmso. What makes this harder is that I have a pretty good life. I'm fairly well off, attractive, know some great people but it's all negated now by something horrible. Anyway I'm probably going to do it sometime this year. Can't sleep.

Backstory:  She broke up with me yesterday and I didn’t know how to handle it so I wrote this poem. It’s shit just like everything else I make. Writing this poem made me cry a fuck tonne. Known her for 4 years. The amount of good memories, the lasting ones, the perfect ones. Anyways, poem.

Dearest mik 

I’m writing your death note

The ice berg to your titanic boat

The salt to your wound

Your biggest doom

I care about you ever so

So it pains me to say 

I lost feelings



Now go on with your day


I’ll leave you on read for hours

I’ll hide and cower


What am I, invisible

To you, I’m fictional.


Those late nights before a maths test,

The nights where we would laugh and cry

Reminiscing and remembering

And now I’m surrendering 


But in the end, it couldn’t have worked

For my expectations were warped


Only 3 months we would last

It sure did go fast


I lost feelings faster


My dearest mik

"Will an air embolism in the arteries hurt?I’m not sure if I can ask this here, but I’m not sure where else to post this... 
How much pain would a self inflicted air embolism have?

I’ve been suicidal since childhood, and after 20 years (since my first suicidal thoughts) I can’t help but to think life is suffering.
I’ve tried many times, but I’ve always had someone who could safe me or found me while I did a suicide attempt. I’m still not sure if I hate it, or if I’m thankful. 

I really don’t mind dying, even right now. My life is going quite good, things are looking good and great, but I still don’t really feel like life has anything to offer me. Life is suffering, and I’m so fed up with that. I used to find the same thoughts with many of my friends, but they managed to commit suicide and at this moment I’m the only one who hasn’t succeeded. 
One of the people who I met recently (he doesn’t know about my suicidal thoughts) said that making your own gun is not that difficult (a more painless way to kill oneself), but I’m from Belgium, so making your own gun or taking your life by gun is not really an option. 
I don’t really care about the pain which might occur during the suicide, but I really wonder if a self inflected air embolism would be an easy way out. Easier than making ones own gun I would expect.

Is there anyone who knows what the pain would be while having a self inflicted air embolism? Google doesn’t really give any answers, so I thought of all places, Reddit might give some insight on this topic.

If I’m posting this on a wrong subreddit, I’m really sorry, I do not wish to offend anyone,  but the question has been on my mind for so long, and I don’t have any friends to share it with anymore, so I thought asking here might clear some of the questions I have.

"Are near constant thoughts of suicide with no intentions of acting on them normal?For the longest time, I've always imagined scenarios of killing myself. Gunshot seems to be my preferred method, though I know I never will actually commit to it for various reasons.

However, nearly every time I swing into my depression modes, I think of suicide. I know I won't do anything about it, but the thought always lingers, sometimes strong, sometimes just an afterthought. I've heard that considering suicide is a sign of a disorder or something, though I feel normal. I don't feel crazy or broken, just sad a lot with that extra caveat of visions of hanging myself, OD'ing on asprin, or blowing my brains out at the thought of being a lonely failure for the rest of my life.

"I just want to be happyI started struggling around 3 years ago. A lot of that time has felt like living through hell.

"You asked out your crush? Well, I never had one! Since this sub has a thing for talking about crushes and being romantic and whatnot, why not do the opposite and talk about being aromantic? 

Hi, I'm 19 and I'm an aromantic heterosexual (*technically* LGBT I suppose) male.

Growing up, I was always repulsed by the idea of romance. I didn't really have the feels for anyone. Whenever I was asked if I liked anyone, I would respond with ""No"", thinking it was a joke question made to make me look bad. If I was asked out, I would always assumed it was joke or a set-up to make fun of me. I just didn't like anyone in that way. I never had any romantic crushes, and unlike most teenagers, I never had thoughts of girls or finding a girlfriend; I was more interested in my own interests, like video games or drawing and whatnot. I had always assumed that no one actually falls in love and that it was just some form of comedy or a schtick or something, but that changed when I entered high school in 2015.

In high school, I noticed that virtually everyone had a significant other. Almost everyone I knew had a partner of some sort. I even assumed everyone in my high school was ""lovesick"" or something. That's when I finally realized that people actually take relationships seriously. Then the pressure really began; I was constantly asked if I had a girlfriend or not, of course I would answer ""No"". Unfortunately, homophobia ran rampant in high school, and I'm pretty sure those questions were asked to weed out any homosexual students to pick on them. (Yes, a lot of people in my high school thought I was gay, most likely because I wasn't interested in finding a girlfriend. This had led to me getting picked on quite a bit.) I then began the search for a girlfriend sometime in 10th grade (2016-2017) out of peer pressure, but with no success. Of course I was getting frustrated from not being able to find a girlfriend, not because I wanted romance, but because I felt left out, as again - everyone in my high school had a significant other and I felt left out (also my heterosexual desires started showing up, heh heh...), and yeah, that was a rough time to say the least.

I then did get a girlfriend in 11th grade (2017), and well honestly, I thought it was supposed to feel different from having a regular friend, but no, it felt exactly the same, except with hugging and kissing. But to be honest, I didn't really care about doing romantic stuff with her (I hated dating or having to say romantic compliments), like I said, I had my own interests. Whenever she showed up to my house, I felt like I wasn't giving her enough attention as I should be giving to her, but I didn't know what to do. She was just there, y'know?

Then I was researching asexuality sometime in the spring of 2020, and discovered that you could have a sexual orientation and a romantic orientation. Initially, I thought romantic attraction was just ""hmm, that person looks nice and they seem pretty friendly. I wanna be with this person and maybe hug them"", but as it turns out, I was WAY off. What I described was strong platonic (and maybe partially sensual) attraction. I maybe aro, but I still experience sexual attraction, and from what I found out later on, romantic attraction is basically the same as sexual attraction, but only with dating and romance instead of sex. In a technical sense, romantic attraction is a chemical release from the brain (learned that from the comments section of an aromantic subreddit) and it's a compulsory desire, like you just got to have it!  Because of what I initially believed romantic attraction was, I identified as a ""biromantic heterosexual"" for a few months because I viewed men and women equally romantically (or so I thought). It was only a while ago that I found out was romantic attraction ACTUALLY meant, and that really challenged what I believed was ""romantic attraction"", as I never felt the urge to be with anyone in a romantic sense or to go out and seek a date. I even feel like I could go my entire life without romance. 

I thought I had experienced crushes, but turns out, those were ""squishes"", which are ""platonic crushes"" if you will. My ""crushes"" were ""out of sight, out of mind""; once that person was out of my sight, they were out of my mind, but apparently real crushes don't work like that. From what I was able to gather, with real romantic crushes, that person would stay in your mind, even long after they've left your sight. The romantic desire for that person is just stuck in your head, and you're just immensely, but involuntarily, thinking about them... and you just can't kick those thoughts away. You have thoughts, hoping that they'll ask you out, talk to you, or even wave back You might even feel ""lovesick"", hoping to see them again. It's almost as if you're obsessed with that one person. Basically, imagine having a song stuck in your head, but amplified by 10 times, and you have the desire to meet whoever wrote that song . That's supposedly the intensity of a crush. To me, crushes sound scary. Like I can't imagine having a person stuck in my head and wanting to live my life with. 

To end this post of, I found out I was aro after realizing the love I had felt towards my girlfriend felt exactly the same as the love I had for my mother; all platonic, and recounting my past ""opinions"" on romance. But yeah, I guess I'll never experience a true crush on someone.  

I have a few questions, since I want to know for myself.

1. Were you ever repulsed by romance or love growing up?
2. Was my description of what a crush is accurate?
3. Do you think you can go your whole life without a romantic partner?

To conclude the story, it's perfectly fine if you don't ever want to date someone. Live your life however you see fit!",normal,low

"I've done something that ruined my life storyOk trying to make this as brief as possible:

Mental breakdown around January last year. Went from an extremely heavy and skinny smoker who only ate garbage to a gym rat. Eating, eating, eating, 4000 calories of the healthiest food per day, becoming strong and healthy. Always hitting the gym. 

However: I get filled with regrets because the contrast is so huge. I feel like I'm about to die. Also get so fucking angry at myself and feel like the biggest failure ever. I mean... Who smokes!? Who neglects his health!? Only losers do that. Self-esteem below zero. Suicidal thoughts. Extremely depressed. 

I contact my ex to talk about it. Look up to her because she's 8 years older. I'm 28, she's 36. I start it off on the wrong foot with extremely negative texts like calling life pointless bullshit (fucking toxic behavior of me) she gets angry and I feel like I have to explain myself. She constantly says something I want to reply to and then blocks me so I keep making new accounts. One time she says 'you didn't change a bit and only went backwards' so I make a new account one last time to reply with 'but I did change'... Then she explodes. Writes a message to hurt me as much as possible and says she will never reply again. Says shit like 'you'll never learn how to live your life'... Saying that to me in my situation is pure poison for my brain. It's black on white and becomes engrained in my brain. Everything went wrong here. How I started it off with those negative texts and then tried to save it by continuing to make new accounts while my ex just wanted me to leave her alone. My ex also being unempethatic as fuck which makes me want to explain myself even more. Her ending it in that horribly cruel last message...

After that it keeps repeating in my head every single minute of the day. I'm so frustrated and sad that she said that to me because it completely ruins my mental health and makes me feel hopeless while she doesn't know the full story. The only thing that made me feel proud of myself is how I've turned my life around, but that feels completely in vain after her last message. I can't cope with it and constantly write messages and delete them again only to write them again everyday explaining myself and apologizing. Telling her I know it was bad what I did. She never replies. After like 4 months of doing that shit she gets rid of her instagram 😓 I wrote a last extremely personal e-mail to her work, but she left that company so it got forwarded to her co-workers. Holy shit. 

Conclusion: I've turned into a stalker. Should I kill myself? I can't live with the embarrassment and shame... It's also not something I did in the heat of the moment. I kept contacting her day after day. It's a pattern. I'm just a fucked up person.",suicidal,high

"Depressed 17 year old: my story, hope it helps raise awareness and ppl can relate Hi all,

This is the second Depression subreddit I have joined. I've decided to speak about my experiences here to see if it can help anyone here or if anyone can help me as I've found some of my posts have no responess.

I'm 17 years old, nearly 18. I'm male. I live in the UK and the past two months have been the toughest in my life. I have been diagnosed with clinical depression, and on medication (will get to that later)

But my story goes back beyond 2 months, so I will start from there.

It's not light reading - in terms of content or length. So I hope you have some patience.

**My experience of bullying**

So I'd say for the entire duration of my adolesence I have struggled in one way or the other. In my first year of secondary school (I'm not sure what grade this is equivelant to in the US and other countries, but the age is 11-12). I'd recently moved to the area. I had a bad feeling about the school from the moment I arrived. My parents however, were keen for me to go. So, I did.

In the summer of 2014, they had a summer school at this school which I attended. That was when my first experiences of bullying there started. Pretty low level. These two girls, stealing my equipment. But it got worse and I ended up having a day or so off. But I did make some friends.

When I started in September that year,I felt alone. I remember texting my mum, as I stood outside in the playground, alone. The ""friends"" I had made, quickly abandoned me. Almost instantly, a campaign of bullying began against me. Firstly, it was just insults and stuff. Low-level stuff, though it did get worse. It was very cliquey - like an american high school or something. Almost everyone bullied me. A lot of them were girls. I started that school with an open mind, perhaps innocent, perhaps naiive. Within weeks, that had all gone. I was hardened. I was bold, I was assertive, something I no longer am. Fights and other acts of violence were almost the norm, happening on a near daily basis. I believed fighting would get me respect, the respect I needed to prove I wasn't gonna take sh\*t from anyone. So, one December morning, I went out into the playground, demanding one of the main bullies come to fight me. Unfortunately, or perhaps fortunately depending on what way you look at it, one of his lackeys showed up instead. *I wanted the organ grinder, not the monkey!* The main bully in question was supposedly in detention, so I had it off with this kid instead. It wasn't really a proper fight, though I guess you coudl say I ""won"", as I ripped his shirt, and he gave up. Eventually, a fellow student managed to mediate some kind of truce between the two of us.

The school's policy was not to expel any kids, regardless of how bad they were, something which worked great for them, but worked terribly for the rest of us. The school's strategy for bullying? They basically told me to accept it and put up with it. This was coming from the head of year, a black woman. I said to her ""*If you were getting racist abuse, would you like it if we told you to ""put up with it""?"" I can't* remember what she sadi to that. anyway, it was decided in the school's infinite wisdom, that i would be moved from one half of the year to the other, so that the bullying would stop. Of course, this didn't happen, as everyone on that side of the year, many of whom used to be my ""friends"" bulied me. Things went from bad to worse. I was physically bullied, but I would retaliate. Something I wish I could have done later. One of the most brutal forms of bullying against me, and I was embarassed to talk about it for years, was when I was lured into an ambush by these girls. They told me this girl liked me, and of course, me being young and innocent, I thought i was going to meet her. I waited outside of the building at lunch, supposedly for this girl to turn up.

The girl did turn up.

But she wasn't alone.

At least three girls I believe, turned up, walking towards me. What was going on? I don't remember exactly what happened next, but this girl accused me of looking up her skirt or something, and then physically assaulted me, and pushed me over this small fence thing onto some dirt. I was kicked and punched. By a girl! It was both humiliating, degrading and upsetting. I cried, and the girl was merely suspended for a day or two as shes just had ""anger issues"". I can't remember what fight it was, but I remember basically the entire year group chased me, hunted for me like some kind of lynching, and faced me off, shouting at me ""We don't want you in our school!"". I got called all sorts. Most of it went on under the very noses of the teachers, who of course, did nothing, either choosing to turn a blind eye, or believing it was merely ""banter"" or some other menial exchange of words. In May that year, I had enough. After seeing a counsellor, I decided to leave. I went to the school which was about a two minute walk from me, which made far more sense, and in hindsight I shoudl ahve gone there from the start.

**The Bullying re-starts**

There was a hiatus of about a year so from this. at my new school, I settled in well, and made a fair few friends. Well, most of them were merely aquitances, but this was like being in a different world compared to where I was before. There was a girl at my new school who went to my old one, and I was always consciously aware she could spill the beans on my background. She did say a thing or two about the incident of me being beaten up by a girl, but she was the kind of girl that pissed everyone off, and so she lost all credibility after repeating it about sxi times.

Year 8 of school (12-13) was a good year, probably my best school year. though looking back i can see the ""friends"" i attatched myself too weren't really friends. I was the white kid who thought it was cool to chill with the black kids, they were like evanangelical christians or something, and I immersed myself into their culture. But I was mostly just used by them for stuff, like buying them lunch. Nothing came of our friendship, and I lost further contact with them when another white kid joined the group and kind of kicked me out. I had also made a group of friends with these other kids who were local to me. In hindsight, they were all little so and sos, which i will rexplain in a moment. We had a good time though.

But as seems to be the case for almost everything in my life, it didn't last.

Put it simply, they turned on me and started bullying me. I think it started over some childish, pathetic thing over fake instagram accounts. I was accused of saying sometyhing to someone, which IU didn't, by one of my friends, turning them all against me. They then bullied me. It wasn't that bad, a lot of it took place online, other times they would do things like trip me up or threaten to fight me. But I was weak and timid, despite probably nearling six foot by this age.

I had no friends. I started going to this place in school. It's called the oasis centre. It's basically for troubled kids who struggle with mainstream classroom learning. I got on really well with the lady who runs it. I know that year I was close to this girl, her name was Grace, and I think I basically got friendzoned on day one, but either i didn't see it, or i didn't care, I was just grateful to have a friend. But...

It didn't last.

As the year progressed, we got further apart. She stopped talking to me in class, she started sitting elsewhere. I later found out she had a boyfriend. I was admittedly quite rude to her in the end, I was jealous I can't lie, but I was so pissed off about being back to square one again.

**The PTSD years**

If the next two years (2017-2019, so aged 14-16) could be characterised by something, it would be my past coming back to haunt me.

I went into Year 10, hoping to start afresh, and almost be treated like a different person. But that...

Didn't happen.

I honestly can't remember too much about what happened in these years, as for some reason my memory of being in Year 10 (14-15) is prety rough, and most of Year 11 (15-16) was characterised by me doing my exams.

The overriding theme however in these years, was the past coming back to haunt me. Meaning? The bullying.

The bullying was probably continuing at this point, but I'm not talking about that. I'm talking about the bullyign i faced in Year 7. They weren't trying to bully me again or something - they couldn't, they went to a different school. But rather, I was becoming increasingly paranoid that somehow, they would find me again, and expose me and reveal how they bullied me, and then bully me again.

This, whilst somewhat irrational, was not completely out of the question. The shitty town I live in (yes its expensive, yes its very green and upmarket but theres nothing to do and i h ate a lot of the people) is small, and everyone seems to know everyone, particuarly with the youth population. Ocassionally, they would try to follow or message me on social media. I began to have nightmares, about being attacked again, about being found by these bullies. I would be so paranoid, whenever I went out in my town centre, I'd either literally hide in the car, or cover my face. My first, and my only instinct, was survival. I knew I couldn't fight - so I had to run, or hide. Something I've done too much of in my life. Running or hiding (avoiding) from situations, people, places. It was no life. I had imprisoned myself in my bedroom, a place where I am still in captivity. I began to see a psycologist, or some other official soundign person. But he never helped. Instead, he just expected me to open up, and seemed to be more interested in my ""*sexual fantasies""* than anything else. But he, and others believed, I could be suffering with PTSD, given my symptoms. I'd go out ,and I thought I would see them, these bullies. But they weren't there.

I did a stupid thing that year. I don't know if it was jealousy or just me being an arse, but I catfished this boy online who I had been good friends with for a long time. Our friendship had drifted apart, and I guess it was just a joke that went wrong. He found out it was me, and it ended. I had fucked things up again. I ended up catfishing other people too. I often ask myself: why? I never did it malicously. One of my rationale - me being very self conscious and self aware that I had never had a relationship - was to create an online persona of a girl that I could claim to have a relationship with, or to have her comment on my pictures. I'm so pathetic honestly. I stopped it earlier this year, though in periods of intense boredom in my life, i've done it. I never really take it very far, and I stopped doing it to people, and instead just got off on it tbh. I've found it weird, but given i've been catfished myself two times (pretty obvious , but perhaps karma lol), I'm actually quite comfortable discussing it, its more common than a lot of people think. As said, I never did it to get nude pictures of people to manipulate them with ,God no. In some ways, it benefited me? How? Because I got to see how other guys talked to girls online, somethign I was ,and probably am still terrible at. It made me realise how much guys objectify women, but also taught me a caht up line or two. I also managed to catch this arse\*hole basically cheating on his gf, as he msessaged me asking me for nudes. I never exposed him though as it would be obvious as to who it would be. this happened quite recently. But alas, back to 2018. Now 2019. In this year, I ignored the fact I had no friends, knowing it was my last year of school, and most of the people i didnt like wouyld be leaving. I focused on my exams instead. In January, I managed to see a specialist, offering help to me with my PTSD or symptoms of PTSD with EMDR. ( Eye movement desensitization and reprocessin ). This is a relatibvely novel treatment, created in 1988. I had never heard of it, and the national health service (NHS), the free at point of use service we have in the UK, had just begun offering it. I was considered eligible for it. It aims to deal with traumatic events, such as rape, child abuse, bullying, etc etc. I can't remember exactly how it worked, but it was less about talking, and more about fiollowing hand or finger movements. Within a few months, I could go out again. I was no longer scared of the past, and the bullies. I credited this to me having faith in God. I still had faith at this point, and I believed God, not the EMDR had helped me. In hindsight, I know it was probably the EMDR that helped, but I was also perhaps unwilling to admit it.

During these years I had also developed problems with my back. I was always self conscious of my rear sticking out quite a bit, and my spine being curved. I found this was due to kyphosis and scoliosis, as well as scheuermanns disease. In the early stages of my diagnosis, I considered killing myself once or twice, just to end the physical and mental pain of it. I couldn't run, my main hobby, my main outlet - was gone. I used to love running. I ran for miles, and miles. In the searing heat, or the frigid snow, I'd be out almost every day. And I loved it. I was self conscious about my increasingly tall stature already, at about 6'2, and having surgery would just make met taller. So I decided against it. But the pain - its bad, and it still hasn't gone. I still can't really run. But I've moved on.

**A new start?**

The summer of 2019 aws one of the best times for me, even though it paled in comparison to other people's summers that involved partying, going to prom etc etc. I had no one to do these activities with. What did I do instead? Quite a lot. I began to see a lot of my grandad. I loved spending time with him. We would sit together in his room in my grandparent's retirement flat, sharing our love of country music, and sharing stories with me. He had dementia, worsening, but we could still talk. It was an extended summer, as due to exams, we finish school about six weeks earlier than everyone else. We went to Barcelona as a family, and then to Norfolk, in eastern england. I had been talking to this girl fir a while, who I had met online through social media.

In the UK, sixth form/college is the equivelant of American High School. I was hoping this would be a fresh start, as most people there were new. However, I struggled severely. I found incredibly difficult, if not impossible, to find peopl to talk to who were willing to sustain a conversation with me. Again, everything was very clicquey. For the umpteenth time in my life. I was alone. The girl I had been talking to online? We had been due to meet, I had been prepared to travel well over an hour, nearly two hours, to see her, but I found out she had been talking to someone else and was having a relationship with them. I was fuming. Then I was just upset.

I seriously considered leaving school, and going to another one. But the other two that I emailed woiuld not accept me. I was screwed. I'd just have to hold out for two years at my current school. I spent mots of my free time in Oasis. I used to like it there, but now most people there were younger than me, i was the only sixth-former there, and i felt so isolated. I hated life.

**Losing Grandad**

When someone you love is suddenly admitted to hospital in an ambulance, it's never good news.

However, my grandad had been in the local hospital so many times, and had left unscathed, usually as a consequence of a urine infection. However, I was well aware of my grandad's age, now 80, and the fact his dementia was worsening. My dad was worried - he had been called at God knows what time in the morning, some ungodly hour, and had lost patience with the hospital barrier, ramming it out of the way, much to the pleasure of other motorists waiting to get in the car park. How he avoided getting fined I still don't know.

Visiting grandad would be a regular occurence in the weeks around Christmastime. What a time! He was increasingly delirious, believing he had been kidnapped by my aunt, and that he had committed a crime that he needed to ""hand himself in"" for.

He was transferred to a smaller hospital. I hated hospitals. But this one in particular. The ward was filled with other mostly elderly patients, with one shouting his head off at 10 second intervals. We'd be sitting around his bed for what felt like hours, painstakingly waiting for dinner to arrive and then for him to eat it. I was impatient, and I regret it. I remember asking my dad one time when we left hospital ""He's not coming out of hospital, is he?"". But my dad appeared to dispute this, believing he was on the road to recovery.

Winter that year was a bleak and blustery affair. It was mild. Wet. Stormy. Windy. Snowless. Everything winter shouldn't be, the winter was. I'll explain it more later, but I believe due to my possible ASD, I ended up having a fixation with the weather and tempreatures, and probably had some kind of ""eco-anxiety"" for a while. It's not something I talk about often, but I do remember constantly reading alarmist headlines with regards to the climate and scarign myself to death about the future. I laugh at this now. How can I worry about what will happen in twenty, thirty years time when I have to worry about just making it to the next day?

It was one morning in...I think it ws January, maybe early February, but I could be wrong, when I was told to come downstairs ""for some news"". This...this was never going to be good. Like when my nan died, I knew something was wrong. ""It's grandad isn't he?"" I said. ""He's got cancer"" dad replied. ""He's got 3-4 months"" or something like that. I instatnyl began to cry. I was already having a sh\*tty morning. My brother did the same. My dad didn't cry, and I've never seen him cry. I applaud him for that. He muts be a very strong man. Though I found out recently he too suffered with depression around this time due to his dad and work pressure.

I saw grandad later that day, in hospital. He was going to be released and sent home. They had given up trying to help rehabilitate his mobility, and would now send him home, his final resting place.

Lockdown in the UK begun on the 23rd March. Schools had ended a few days earlier, the government bowing to the inevitable. I had no idea when we would be back ,but in some ways, lockdown had done me a favour: it meant that a large chunk of those two years at sixth form could be bypassed.

Lockdown was eerie. For the first time in my life, there was uncertainty as to whether there would be food on the table. Okay, maybe that is *slightly* dramatic, but nonetheless, there was a risk we would go hungry. I remember queuing up outside of shops, something that seems surreal, as we all piled into supermarkets, maskless, and standing right next to each other in the middle of a FUCKING PANDEMIC.

Two days into lockdown - the 25th - my nan emailed me. something vague about wanting to speak to a doctor. My nan usually sends erratic and erroneous emails and so I chose to ignore it, though I showed dad. He then got a call from nan.

There was a knock on my door.

There was bad news.

Grandad had taken a turn for the worse. He wasn't well.

I had not been there when my nan on my mum's side of the family had died, and I wasn't going to do the same with my grandad. ""Yes"" I said, when my dad asked me if I wanted to come. I had a duty to.

I dropped the coursework I was wroking on, grabbed my phone and a charger - and we were off. 60. 70. 80. We were speeding down that highway as if it were a racetrack. It was completyely void of other traffic though. We arrived, passing friends of my grandad, oblivious to the fact he was on his deathbed. Nan had chosen to keep it from them for now. I went in to see my grandad. Social distancing had gone out the window.

Grandad...grandad was in a bad way. His breathing - it wasn't right. I've never been wiht someone when they were dying before, and it made me a lot more emotional than I thought. I began to cry, as I clenched his hand. I couldn't tell if he was trying tol say something or not. He couldn't speak.

We left, and headed home.

It was later in the evening, when we got a call: grandad had died.

There was no emotion, it was, after all, the inevitable. I cracked open a bottle of cider, the only alcohol I knew at that point, and drank. One of those days! Little did I know there would be plenty more of them to come.

The cermation was a solitary and grim affair. I didn't even have a proper suit. I just wore an old school shirt and tie, my grey coat, and a pair of trousers and school shoes. I remember my nan's funeral, it was bright and lively. This was just depressing. The limits on people meant hardly anyone could be there. I had often planned about speaking about grandad's life to a large audience, but this sort of celebration never happened. The only comfort we were allowed was to toucha nd put a rose on the coffin as its made its way into the chapel. Ironic. Grandad was an atheist. The chapel doors were then promptly shut. And that was it. We were to disperse. I cried. I had not only lost my grandad. I had lost a friend. A fucking, fucking good friend. In some ways, despite the age difference, he was almost like a brother to me. And the worst part of it? WE couldn't even give him the send off he deserved.

**Lockdown**

The first few weeks of lockdown weer okay. I tried to be optimisitc, patriotic even, thinking that this virus could genuinely be defeaten. I tired to think of the wars in the past and how my ancestors would have coped. All we had to do was stay inside. I told myself to stop worrying, and make the best of long walks in the frosty mornings. It really was surreal, and a part of me embraced this dystopian like world. Wearing a mask was a novelty then, I had worn one before lockdown even began. But after a few weeks, when it became clear that this would go on for more than a month, I became depressed. Particuarly given my birthday, which really was, despite my mum's best efforts, pretty crap.

I wanted to make tghe most of lockdown by using it as an opportunnity to try and build relationships, friendships and otherwise, online. My new years resolution was to get a girlfriend. I was, and still am, hugely self conscious. I hate the way I look. My parents tell me im handsome and that - but they're your parents. They're not going to tell you you're fucking ugly are they? I talked to lots of girls. Nothing ever came. One of the girls i talked to - and when i say talk, i mean pretty brief - was this girl in Oasis. Her name was Alana. When i first saw her there, i thought she was about 13/14. Year 9. I found her attractive, and im cringing because of this, because I liked her tits. I found out she was year 8, which means 12/13, so i kind of stopped feeling that way about her. But in lockdown, I admitted to her online I did find her attractive. When she asked me what i liked about her? I said her tits. I'm a terrible person. I don't know what age i thought she was then, 12 or 13. She said she had a girlfriend, and nothing happened.

A month later ,she asked me out. This flattered me, because this was the first girl to ever ask me out. How fucking pathetic. I said i hjad to ""think about it"". this was a delaying tactic. I knew it would be weird, especially when I established she was a fcouple of monthgs away off being 13. I'm not sure if i knew this from the start, and i have beaten myself up about this fact in the last three months or so. I ended up asking online what ppl would think of a 13y/o going out with a 17/y/o - i turned 17 a month before. The responses, confirmed my belief that this wouldn't be a good idea, even if I didn't engage in any kind of sexual activity with her. she wanted me to screw her! she asked me ""what would you do to me?"" I could kind of see where this was going. ""What do you mean?"" i ASKED. ""Sexually"" she replied. I was like ""Nothing, because you're underage"". FFS. Had I given out the wrong impression? I can't remember everything I said, but I do ask myself if i did give the idea that when we originally spoke i wanted to go out with her or something. Either way, I felt bad after first saying this, but still - did i know her age or not? She clearly acted very old for her age. She tried to convince me we could have some kind of sexual relationship, but I said no. And that was the end of it =- but all thes emonths later, I worry myself sick with this.

**My first (and only) girlfriend**

The sad thing about that girl, is that I for a moment did consider about going out with her. Why? I was lonely. So, fucking lonely and pathetic. I didn't want sex from her or whatever. I even thought just about saying we were going out for lockdown, giving me time to think about it so i didn't have to see her, just to say I HAD a girlfriend. But, I'm glad I didn't just go for the first thing to come to me, esepcially not her.

I began to post more on instagram in lockdown, and I re-made contact with a girl i knew from primary (elementary school). she was a couple of years younger than me (15) and began commenting on my pictures. She offered to meet me - we did so as friends. Her name was Katie. I really liked her. She was attractive, and I loved her personality. She was kind and everything. One day when we were talking online, she dropped in ""I really need a bf"" midway through a converation, casually. I offered to be hers- and she accepted. The euphoria I felt! I had a girlfriend. All these years. Finally, I had struck lucky.

I remember our first date. A day or so before, trying my luck, I went to an off license and bought a bottle of vodka. I blagged my way through it,. I had been told they sold to under 18s. It wasn't even proper vodka, smirnoff ice or something. i took it with me on our first actual date. I remember sitting by the side of a dual carriageway with her, my hands around her as we drunk vodka straight from the bottle! Fuck me, we must have looked rough. But she really wasn't.

We walked and talked across town, ending up at another off license, where I bought more booze. Don't even know what it was, but it was good. We ended up snogging in the middle of a park! I was chuffed. Finally, finally. Life was being good to me. Things only got better. We met again, and again. At my house, we went for a picnic at the park, we went on ad ay out to London. This may sound sad, but this was probably one of the best times of my life, and the best thing of this entire cursed year.

But.

It had to end.

And it only had to end too fucking soon.

About a month and half or whatever, she sends an ominous text about wanting to speak. she says she wants to postpone our next meeting to take a break. I'm shitting myself - is it a break up - but she says no. And so I let it be. She goes on holiday. No, this isn't the bit where she meets another boy. It's the bit where I seemingly f\*ck things up again. I'd noticed shed always sounded a bit prejudiced when talking about Muslims and other groups. More scared of them than anything. I just casually asked her about it, what she was afraid of. She flipped. She began spouting out general right-wing, racist/islamaphobic rubbish about muslims and black people. She saiud i was weird for asking her about this. I noticed she then didn't respond ot my messages properly, like one word answers. i asked whats wrong. she wasked to break up. i was upset. i was devastated. I hated myself. Why did it have to end? I asked. Everytime I get something good in my life, it dissapears!

**The Depression begins**

Somehow, we managed to remain on rather amicable terms, staying friends and keeping in touch. I'm not lying when I say she texted me every day. I still had feelings for her. But they weren't replicated.

We arranged to meet. For the first time since we split up - as friends. We chose the gym, as we both shared an interest in boxing. I liked boxing. Why? I realised I was half decent at it - I had so much agression inside of me, I had to channel it into something. I had turned to the bottle. Spurred on by muy success in aquriing vodka in an off license, I had also managed to get served in lots of pubs. I wasn't drinking that often. But it became an outlet for me. Alone, of course. I remember one afternoon, I came back from school. I was so angry - at my self! I had no one to blame. I just went out. I said I was going to the gym. That was a half truth. I spent the first half an hour going through town, trying to get served, throwing money down the drain as they wouldn't. I went to the gym in the end.

When I saw Katie that day, I realised how much I missed her. What I was missing. It was almost torture to cotninue to be friends with her, but she convinced me she had MH problems of her own, and that iw as her only friend. so i stayed. But that day, I went to the pub straight afterwards - double whiskey. Scotch. It was good.

But even our friendship had to end.

I was talking to her for a while before, and she was getting quite agitated at times. She said stuff like ""appreciate me - i'm all you've got"", taking advantage of the fact that it was true - she *was* my only friend. Then hse accused me of arguing with her when she said she thought I had autism, and I challen ged this. She finally flipped one day when we were etxting, casually, she said she had to stay behind at school for revision. ""that's rough"" or something lik ethat i replied. All of a sudden, she swears at me, her friends send voiec messages saying im weird, that she doesn't like me, and she blocks me. I'd had enough. It was my fault, AGAIN! I ran downstairs, looking for the first alcoholic drink I could find - cider, took it with me, and stormed out into the fields, sobbing my fucking heart out. Not just about Katie. But everything. I was a freak. I was always to blame. I couldn't do anything right! That day had torrential, and I mean torrential rain. I went outside, getting myself soaked whilst drinking. I don't know what I intended to do - run away perhaps? Kill myself? Fuck knows. But it didnt last long because my mum saw me and took me back home

**Suicidal Thoughts**

I began to feel extremely suicidal. I contemplated death - how would I die? I planned on suicide by cop. It's very easy to get shot by the police. This is not juts an american phenonemon. You can easily call the police, claim to have a gun or a bomb, ro say you've seen someone, wallk up towards the police, and they will shoot you. It makes you feel you have control in your death too. If you get cold feet, you can surrender. However, I was aware that I'd be putting the officer through the psycological trauma of potentially killing an innocent person. an innocent, suicidal person at that. i'd rather kill myself wiothout having to involve anyone. jumping in front of a train? A train driver will be left scarred for life, and potentially passengers. Overdosing seemed too 50/50. Eventually, my parents and school found out, and I had to get emergency phsyicatric help. They diagnosed me with clinical depression, and I saw a private consultant who diagnosed me with the same. I began my first dose of antidepressants - 20mg of flureoxeotine. It sent me up the walls. I was now off school. Before that, I already wasn't eating. I just stayed in bed. I couldn't do anything. I would now have prolonged outbursts. I'd self harmed 3 times. A fourth on the higher dose. But where before I was sleeping loads, now i kept waking up. My dreams - so vivid! I'd have struggle to pass water. Very low sex drive. Suicidal thoughts. The medication was not working.

I was getting so obsessed and upset about this girl, the one who was in year 8. What if i did know her age and still said i liked her? I must be a peadophile? I deserve to die, im a terrible person? Did i say this? wait, did I say thjat? i was dreaming, thiking id said stuff which i had to wake up and ask myself - of course i didnt! I cried so much. About my grandad. Having no friends. Hating myself. The problem is me!

The closest I came to do anything suicidal was out on a walk.

The day in question - a saturday. The first day of my new job. My first job, at a supermarket. a few months prior, i would have jumped at the chance, but now i was not os sure. I've been crying lately by the easiest things. an emotional piece of music, a thought here, nature here. it makes me well up and cry. I burst out crying in broad daylight that morning.

I went past these vicious, barking dogs at a farm - usually I would have shat myself and ran. But I didn't! I just stood there, and faced htem off. Nothing could scare me - if they attacked me, it wouldb e painful, but i could die at least! I crossed a bridge across the motorway. We had passed under it in a car so many times. I had seen on another bridge earlier that tyou could get tyour feet onto a surface ont he ohter sidef. I went to the side, not on the road, but just bnefore it went over the road. I climbed over, and edged towards the carriageway. I turned back. It was so spontaneous. Like the self harm. I hate the way I look. I'm skinny, i must be ugly, ive only had one gf and it didn't even last two months! Girls comment on my pictures for jokes. I went home and cried. I cried basically every day after that.

**The present?**

A week on from the bridge incident, I still feel so depressed. I've started back at school - an achievement, but its making me feel worse. A few people were pleaesd to see me back. It touched me in a way. I'm sure im not alone when i say suicidal people have contemplated who would be at their funerals. I'm sick of living this life. Seeing other people livign their life, going to parties, having sex, having friends and things to do. I'm juts a pathetic, sad excuse of a person. Who in their right mind is attracted to a 12/13 year old at my age? Who would make fake girlfriends because they're alone? Apparently I'm basically at the threshold for ASD. I'm getting a diagnosis, a proper one in the new year, which both reassuresm e, but also makes me feel i might just have to give up on a socail life. im fed up of living my life alone. no - im not living. im existing. I sometimes go to sleep, and hope i dont wake up. I feel like dying would take a burden off the shoulders around me. I'm disgusting. im a freak. im weird, im pathetic. But anyway, this is how someone gets to a position like this. Everyone has their own jounries and how they ended up with depression, and I encourage you to share yours if you feel comofrtable. Fuck me, its taken a long time. I'm surprised I haven't cried yet. im willing to answer or talk to anyone below. Advice, comments, criticism, whatever, feel free to put it below. I have no faith anymore, I've given up in believing in a God that would inflict such suffering on a person who has tried to be the best they can, and the suffering on the world that we have endured. If there is a God, he must be punishing me. I'm going to be 18, and to show for it? Nothing. my 18th will just be me alone. I've drunken a lot lately. Whiskey. I even had a cigarette when offered by a guy at my work. It was the only thing that could calm me down that first ,stressful shift when my thoughts about that girl, alana and everything else was goingf around my head at 100mph. Don't intend on making a habit of that though. I'm just fed up of living alone. People acted concerned when i was off (ive missed 5 weeks off skl and now worried as im supposed to be doing exams this year and then going to university) but acted like i didn't exist when I *was* at school. My life has had its good moments, but tragically, having written this, I've actually realised how much suffering I've endured over the last six years, though this probbaly styill pales in comparison to others, and if you're still going after losing multiple family members, having a life threaten*ng or changing* condition/illness, living in poverty etc, I salute you.

"My team leader challenged me to kill myselfIm posting this in r/army also. So im in the army right, Ive only been in 6 months as a 11b. I got to my duty station 3 months ago at FT Wainwright. After getting to my unit I received the normal smokings/hazings of being a new infantry private. I understood it and it only lasted about a week. But this one E-4, im an E-1, decided that smoking me everyday for no reason was the right way to indoctrinate a new member of the team. Getting treated like a piece of shit for no other reason than being new took a toll on me. I started having depression about 2ish months ago and it built up to me overdosing on feb 28th on proprananol. I was prescribed proprananol for my hyperactive thyroid which is another story. So i overdosed 28th got sent down to Joint base elmendorf richardson to be a patient at the bhu. Spent a week there. It really helped i was happier than ive ever been in the army. Mostly because I was away from the toxic enviroment. I got back here yesterday night. Today my Team leader and i were talking and he said he did not believe i took all the pills and that i only took some of them just to get attention. And he then said why would you not just use a gun and proceeded to imply i was a pussy for not using that method. Then babbled off how people in my platoon have gone through much tougher things which I agree with. I guess im just weak. And i asked him then if he was challenging me to kill myself which he didnt say anything and we proceeded to sit in awkward silence. I would just like to hear what you have to say on the situation im not looking to get him in trouble he PCS's in a month anyways. And even though ive only been back for a day i can tell im going to slip back into a depression quickly.

"I Feel I’m At A Low Point In My LifeFor four years of my life I’ve had depressing thoughts and thoughts of taking my own life.

"I Feel Like Leaving This Awful World is the Only Way I'll Ever Get PeacePlease read my previous post to get context. Link:

 https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/idyt4f/i_think_quitting_is_the_only_option_left_for_me/

First of all, I am really really grateful for all of you who tried to help me. But now I really really feel like quitting is the only option left for me in order to get peace.

Although I tried my best to feel better and avoid quitting (which did not work at the end) after you all tried your best to help me, this ""family"" is constantly pushing me towards the path of suicide. As you know, my ""father"", ""step-mother"" and ""sister"" have completely isolated me. These 3 are always together, discussing various things among themselves, being happy and telling each other bad things (which are actually false) about me. They are always happy whenever I am not with them. Whenever I go near them, they give each other a disgusted look and remain silent till I leave the room. Whenever one of them is facing any trouble (for example, a mild headache), the other 2 just jump in out of nowhere and start sympathizing (over-the-top sympathy) with that person, give him/her medicines and constantly ask him/her if he/she is feeling better or not. Whereas, when I face any problem (for example, injury in my right knee), they do not even bother trying to help me. They just ignore me continue doing whatever they were doing before being interrupted.

Sometimes, my Intermittent Explosive Disorder gets triggered when I reach the saturation point of handling the stress. When this IED gets triggered, I loose all my control and become violent. In order to prevent myself from hurting those 3, I cover my face with a pillow and lie on/under the bed as long as I am in this state. Another reason for covering my face with a pillow is to hide my tears because I cry a lot when my IED gets triggered because my father, step-mother (even my biological mother used to) and sister say really nasty things (like I should die, that I have never given them any peace since I was born and that I am insane and evil). But those 3 think that I get possessed in this state (I have told them about IED but they don't really believe me) and they try to exorcise me. They do this by letting my father put his entire body weight on my back (to immobilize me) and my sister and step-mother do some Illogical bullshit like sprinkling some holy water on me, using some other superstitious things and so on. This in turn makes me really frustrated (please note that I cannot talk properly in this state; I told them about this countless times when I am normal but they don't listen) and I lose whatever little control I had and start physically fighting them (usually just my father). When my sense finally comes back, I see that my father is slightly injured (for example, a small cut and a little thrombosis) and that nearly my whole body is injured (like severe pain in my shoulders, waist and knees &amp; deep cuts on my limbs). Then, my step-mother and sister sympathize with my father and give him ointments and medicine and start blaming me for it. But when I show them MY injuries, they just say that I deserve them and do nothing about it. My father usually gets fully recovered within 2-3 days, but I cannot even walk properly for 2-4 weeks. I have IED since I was 8/9 years old and whenever it got triggered when I was a child, my father, biological mother and sister used to say and do nasty things including threatening to throw me out of the house, beating me with a wooden rod, threatening to kill me with an ignited matchstick and so on. They still do all these things (only difference is that my step-mother is in place of my biological mother).

You know what destroyed me the most? I used to share my thoughts and beliefs with my ""sister"" (including my views on life and my depressive/suicidal thoughts), who ACTED like she could understand my pain and suffering. Even she used to ""agree"" with me (which I NOW realise were totally LIES). You know what she did? She stabbed me in the back and told EVERYTHING I told her to our ""father"" and ""step-mother"" and they have now formed a union against me. She has now showed me her true face, which is exactly the opposite of how she acted before. After telling them everything, she is now constantly flattering our ""father"" and ""step-mother"" and bashes &amp; insults me (along with my ""father"" &amp; ""step-mother"") at every chance she gets. It was like she was a secret agent. Whenever I try to confront any 1 of them, he/she calls the other 2, they get united, and start bashing &amp; shouting at me (like calling me USELESS, SELFISH, UNGRATEFUL and LAZY). 

I feel like life is just a curse. It is definitely NOT a gift as the society says. You come to this dying planet without your consent, spend the first 2-3 years being completely depended on strangers (who are apparently your ""family""), then as soon as you can do some basic things on your own (like walking, talking, etc.), your ""parents"" force you to go to various HELLS (which are called schools, colleges and universities by the society) FOR 15-20 YEARS, where they put unnecessary, immoral, Illogical, impractical pressure on you (which becomes a major reason for suicide for a lot of people) so that you get ""good marks/grades"" without which you cannot get a ""job"". As soon as you get out of these hells, you have to find a job (so that you don't fucking starve), a job in which you have to work 8 hours a day, 5-7 days a week in order to make someone else rich, just to prevent yourself from starving to death. How long do you have to do this? Till your body becomes SO WEAK that you are unable to do the job (which is called ""retirement"" by the society""). Then you will develop some chronic disease and you will have to spend the rest of your miserable life suffering beacuse of it. Then one day, you finally die. And the most awful thing is that this whole process of life also include various AWFUL things like mental illness, physical illness, crime, corruption, injustice, inequality, discrimination, poverty, selfishness, accidents, natural crisis and disasters, etc. 

Apparently, YOU are mentally ill for going against this system and need help, help from the ""professionals"" who are only interested in brainwashing you and giving you as many medicines as possible. After getting such ""help"", you are expected to be ""cured"" and to go back to being a mindless societal slave, because if you don't, you can just starve to death, the society is NOT going to help you because you are useless to them. Oh, and don't kill yourself because apparently, your ""family"" and this society ""cares"" about you. You know why I hate people the most? They fucking REPRODUCE (instead of adopting the children, who are already suffering in this world, to make their life a little better) in this ATROCIOUS, AWFUL world. They don't actually give a damn about their children, who will suffer just because they were brought to this awful world by their ""parents"". These ""parents"" actually only care about themselves. 

Am I really the one who is mentally sick here? I feel like leaving this awful world is the only way I can ever get peace. Even now I think that my mind and spirit have already died and only my body is barely alive. Please tell me any surefire way to die because I don't want to be arrested by the police in case I fail to die.",suicidal,high

Before winter break even ended I got several school assignments graded poorly. That made me want to work even harder but now i just feel like I’ve been failing really hard. Today some decisions I made a while ago came to bite me in the ass and now I can’t sleep because all the shit on my mind. I actually can’t remember the last time I had a good night sleep. I keep on telling me it’s all gonna be ok but if I don’t shape up soon this could affect my entire life. After all this I’ve been doing some reflecting and I’ve realized how alone I am. I’ve always know this and I’ve always passed it off as jokes so what not but I’m really alone. I have 3 good friends and 2 of them I only get to hang out with over Xbox. The 3rd one I haven’t seen for like a month because of virtual school even though we still talk a lot over discord. I’m really getting worried about my social life because I’m 15 and don’t have any real close ties and I won’t even start on talking to girls cuz I’m completely hopeless especially because my greatest skill is bottling up my emotions. I think my bottling of emotions comes from me dealing with my mom. She’s got a lot of her own shit but basically whenever she gets really mad at me, my brother or dad she just really tries to hurt us. Like REALLY hurt us. I’m the only one in the family who she doesn’t know anything about and I’m aware that that protects me so I don’t tell anyone anything. I also fell really bad about this but I absolutely hate my brother and I can’t deny it anymore even though I know how unfair it is to him. He’s never done anything wrong but the fact that he’s naturally stronger, has a promised future, has plenty of friends and can do basically anything I can do but better just makes me of course super jealous even though he’s barely done anything to deserve me hating him. On top of all these things I’ve been having essential crisis’. The stress, hatred and sadness have left me wanting to just end it all and give up but I think the only thing keeping me from doing so is that I’m too scared of what’s beyond. Also the fact that I’m aware of all these things makes me think I can and should be able to better myself, but I just can’t and that makes me hate myself even more.

"Here's my story.Hi,

I thought it would be a good idea to share my story with you guys on here.
When I was little, my parents didn't much care about my feelings or my interests. I was different than them, being a lot more passionate and explorative. My faher acred the least and my mother was just scared about me getting hurt. I am a hemophiliac since birth, which means, that I have to take medication to make my blood clott the way it should. Hemophiliacs usually tend to have more serious injuries as children, so my mother made sure I missed out on a lot of fun. In some serious cases I can recall very well, she kept me from doing things with friends, like ice-skating or taking the public bus on a stormy, snowy night, that eventually led me to thinking that I should never ever be happy and feelings are bad. There were different factors to this. Another big issue was, thatby the age of six my first rolemodel whom I truly loved died. Everyone in my family was happy about it finally happening and I wasn't allowed to be on the funeral for it being ""too sad"". So I ""learned"" that not was it only wrong to be happy, it was also bad to mourn and noone told me how to work with negative emotions. I stuck to books. My parents having received only basic education couldn't keep up with me. Then some other people in my family died from various illnesses, and two other rolemodels I had, one in a very tragic accident. All in all, I visited 9 funerals. What actually bummed me out the most, was that I hadn't been able to sleep with as much women. My relationships were longtime, starting when I was 16, 2-3 years at least, with a few months between them. But with each I had more and more problems to open up, to let her help, talk about my worries and so on. I was told that it's all a matter of perspective and the good things in life will always prevail. So I did go outisde, met new people, tried out different sports, hobbies, you name it. Every single one of these activities left a sour taste and got boring after a while. I found out that I am really good in seeking the negative aaspects of something and using them to destroy the good image I had before, so I can throw it away. (this stems from my happy childhood). Well, what was left was to obey, learn and follow the rules. Life is so much easier with rules! I ended up as a student, I'm going to be 27 next month with 8 months to graduation left. I'm an A Student, but I don't care at all. Everytime I aqcuire a new qualification or knowledge, it becomes stupid, easy, I dislike it and hate myself for not being much better at it than everyone else.

So...My last girlfriend just broke up with me because she found out that she doesn't quite like me as much as she thought she would. At this point, she gave me a reason to live, honestly. We had the year planned out: friends, festivals, vacation...everything. Now I'm again at a point where nothing makes sense. I am going to finish my studies, because that's just what you do, it's the right thing. As much as I want to build myself a cabin somewhere and live there all by myself or go exploring the world, I am not going to follow any of these impulses, because I hate myself so much for having them. I'd rather die. I have been on different vacations, in different countries but afterwards it never left me with the thought of having learned or achieved something. We are all going to die, the universe will collapse - all the happy days you had do not. make. sense! That's what I think when I remember something happy. And I can't stop myself from doing so. It feels so natural and right to think this way, that I do not want to change it. I think that emotions are a sign of weakness and that there would be no way ever to lower myself so much, as to the point where I could love myself and life self aware about my body, my needs, my everything. Avoiding any contact and effort that leads to this is kind of my ultimate goal. But yeah, it makes me quite depressed, which is something I came to accept.

I have told this to various people in my life and also did two therapies, but my life didn't get better in any way. I just know all of the above now and the connections, therapy couldn't help me get rid of my negative thinking. You see, it is just not an option for me to give in to my needs. There just isn't. The only two ways out I see now is to find a drug strong enouh that will completely destroy my ability to feel anything at all or to kill myself, which I rather wouldn't do, because that's just not a thing you do.

Any advice?",suicidal,high

"May loose full time job and full ride scholarship...Ill try to keep it quick. Basically Im in a very very very good situation right now as a young man. Im in a special program that fully pays for my education while teaching me a trade and pays me 35k a year basically right out of high school, zero debt, living comfortably and independently.

But recently, ive been having a hard time retaining and understanding certain concepts in my trade resulting in a low grade in my evaluation and its 3 points from failing. If I dont get it up next month, I loose everything... im getting tested for ADD to see if that's the problem. Its a very complex trade. 

Anyways, I know for a fact that I'll never get an opportunity like this again and im seriously considering ending it all if I get fired/kicked out of this program. I don't believe in god and I don't think anything supernatural happens after you die. I feel like life truly is pointless and we will never understand our existence so why not just end it all. Also, just seeing how so much evil, violence, and environmental destruction is in the world the just makes me want to not be a part of this reality anymore. 

But if I bring my grade on the job up, graduate and keep the money flowing, I see no reason to give up that life. ",suicidal,high

"I might be about to flunk out of college again.I need a 2.0 gpa this semester to stay in school. I have been struggling with alcoholism for years and I finally got my act together this semester. Unfortunately I was not 100% committed to my coursework until halfway through the semester.

I am less than 1% away from getting that 2.0 Literally 6 points away in one of my classes. I have been sober for a month now. I have tried so hard to catch up. I tried so hard. I passed all my classes. I am/was so close. I emailed my professor in a professional manner, inquiring about his policy when it comes to rounding up grades to the nearest integer, as it's not mentioned in the syllabus.

I wrote a candid letter about my situation, explaining everything I've been through to that professor. But I haven't sent it. I wrote it, but I don't want to embarrass myself. It'd be so unprofessional to send that, right? I can't straight up ask for a grade bump. I know I don't deserve a C- in his class... but I am so close. SO close. I hid the fact that I flunked out last year from my whole family. I hid it from everybody. I worked so hard this semester and got decent grades in half my classes.

I am so close and I know that he won't round it up that half percent. There might be a curve but he hasn't specified at all. I sent the email 5 minutes ago, so I have to be patient until tomorrow. 

How do I face my parents how do I face myself how will I ever have confidence again

I feel paralyzed. Idk what's going to happen. I don't want to kill myself but I want to die if I fail. I haven't had a drink. I'm staying strong for now but come tomorrow I don't know what will happen.

I have a 69.6% in that class. Final grades are in. I got As on the first two exams, and a C on the final. I was so close. I only turned in half the assignments. I missed four out of the eleven quizzes. I can't fucking believe I did this.

My other classes are a B+, a C+, and a D. the D was differential equations and I tried even harder in that class. No matter what I did  I had such a hard time performing on the tests.

"I want to die by the end of this month.I find myself unable to cope with the fact that I see no future for myself. I've never been able to find a job that interested me enough to pursue a career before, and while I've done well in school I've never finished a degree because, frankly, it doesn't interest me. I haven't had any luck finding work recently and I am rapidly running out of economic resources at which point I won't be able to afford my phone bill and my chances of finding work without a working phone will become even more difficult.

I have no possibilities of establishing a meaningful romantic relationship because I never really meet women. All of the women I know that I think it would be fun to get to know better and date are all in relationships, so I don't really see a future for myself in this area of my life. I find that women just generally aren't that attracted or interested in me. 

I can thankfully say that I have one or two incredible friends in my life that I actively have a back and forth relationship with. I thought for a long while that I had many friends that were as interested in keeping in touch with me as I was with them. This turned out not to be the case. What I have come to realize is that almost of all the friendships (with the exception of the one or two incredible friends mentioned above) I thought I had turned out to be over glorified acquaintances even though I've know some of them for years. That might not be the best term for what I am trying to describe. I feel that in most of my friendships, I was the only party in the friendship that made the effort to communicate or make plans. No one would ever call me or talk to me unless I talked to them first or made plans. 

I am tired of being invisible. I am tired of being this person. I am tired of being a person who other people aren't interested in, who has no one to share their interests with, and with no economic future. I am tired of feeling like I have to adapt to others to be accepted. I am tired of having no energy. I am tired of being unwanted. I am tired of being me.

"Here we go againI'm 41. Single day of 2 amazing kids, 6 and 5. I have them with me after the divorce. Thats the only reason why I'm not dead. 

Ive been depressed for years. In and out of counseling. I have PTSD (not combat related). During this time of year, and I think its because of the trauma of the breakup of my marriage, I absolutely lose it. This is the 2nd year its happened. I begin to not be able to make it to work. I get the kids up and off to school, get ready, and drive there. Sometimes I just cant make it inside or if I do I cant stay all day. I was out last year for almost 2 months straight. So of course, I'll have no money to compound my issues. Today is one of those days where I cant make it inside. 

When I woke up I was tired and angry. My sweet little girl didn't want to put on jeans. So I flipped my shit and yelled when I should have just got her the pants she wanted. I felt like such a piece of shit. I talked to her after and she was okay, but I basically woke her up and made her cry and now I'm going to have to deal with weighing on me. She didnt deserve it.

I try really hard but I just get so angry. Their mom is supposed to have the kids. On paper I get weekwnds only. But she chose to be with a child (20 when she is 38) over her own kids. Of course, I take the kids and I need them because they keep me alive. But she offers no help. Just a hard way to go. When my brain breaks down she wont help with the kids. And it makes me so angry. I try so hard. I'm taking her to court for child support and some accountability, but its so long and drawn out. I'm out of money and the lawyer is not really doing all he can. 

I know I'm rambling. Im sorry. I realize there are people here who will end it all, and honestly I'm not going to. But I want to. I want to just be gone. Just to not have to feel the pain. But theres some joy in life. Kids smiles mainly. Lile I said, they are the only thing keeping me alive.  I have a great family and a wonderful girlfriend. I'm just lost. So very lost. Id be okay with going in my sleep. Or a car crash. Something explainable. Something so the kids can say, ""Daddy didn't kill himself."" But the honest truth is I'm almost 41. Ive screwed my brain up with drugs in my youth. This all seems to be my fault, and I really just want to go.

And I know this is gonna sound like esoteric bullshit, but I really think I have something influencing my thoughts that is not of this world. I dont think its a demon and I'm not religious, but I fucked around with the supernatural a lot and I think this may have Something to do with how I feel. I could just be crazy though.

"r/confession didn't help me. Can you?I'm 18, and I realized that I basically downloaded and masturbated to child porn.

Nothing explicit, it was just suggestive. As much as I'd like to condemn the people who do have sex with children, who am I to talk? And not just now, this was shortly after my 18th birthday, which now was a few months ago. I downloaded and jacked off to pictures of Ariel Winter at the 2014 SAG Awards one day and Miley Cyrus in some old episode of Hannah Montana on another. But it doesn't matter, because both of these can qualify as child porn. After looking up the laws on it, I'm convinced it does. I regret it, haven't done it since, and I'd take it back in a heartbeat but I can't. 

And I feel like this just going to hang over my head for the rest of my life. The fact that I did it at all makes me a disgusting POS. I would say I'm not attracted to children, but what's the point in that? Who would believe me?

I feel like I'm not human. Wherever I go it's like I'm different from everyone else. Like everyone else is normal and I'm just a walking pile of dark sin and filth. My guilt is eating at me. I can't let myself think for a second that these were just mistakes I made, and I can move on and a normal, decent person; I don't deserve that. I also worry chronically about it. I live with a paranoia that I've ruined my own life now. Some day what I did will catch up with me. And it will be a crutch that I won't be able to shake off. But the persecution might as well start now, because I have persecutory delusions. I'm just lying here on my bed and I feel like I'm being slandered for it. I won't let myself be happy.

"I'm 28 and a bottom of the barrel human and I just want out [Long]Hey Guys,

I'm using a throwaway because people know my main account.  Looking from the outside, my life looks pretty great. I have a job that pays decently enough in NYC, I have a studio to come home to, and I never have to worry about my finances, but I'm at a point where I don't want to go on anymore.

By my family standards, I am a complete failure. I never could compare to my 4.0 GPA family, my job pays less than $100k compared to them who make way more than that and they constantly let me know what a failure I am.  I want to have confidence within myself, but my family is right. I am stupid as all hell. What takes some people 2 seconds to do takes me hours to figure out. I can't see things that are literally in front of me. I cannot comprehend simple things. People tell me to believe in myself and be confident, but in order to believe in myself or be confident, I need to have a quality within me that is worth being proud of. I have nothing. I am pathetic, I am stupid, I am weak-minded, I am ugly (I've went from 260 lbs to 200 lbs over the last six months, weight loss did my improve my confidence, nor did it magically fix my ugly-ass face) and as a result, I have ruled out my options of ever finding someone.

On top of all these short-comings that make me a low-tier human being, I have a shitty personality to boot. I'm selfish, a borderline sociopath because I cannot empathize, impulsive, and a coward. I cannot stand up for myself. Whenever conflict begins to show a fraction of uprising, I can physically feel my testicles retract into my body, my hands lose all their strength, I get light-headed and my adrenaline starts pumping because I'm such a cowardice little bitch. I am pathetic...

Yet, here I am wanting to be a middle to higher-tier human being. I know what a shit stain of an existence I am, but yet, my stupid brain tells me I want to be more. I've tried, I've tried to hard to better myself, but what can someone like me do. I'm too stupid to go back to school, and I'm too much of a coward to speak up for myself at work to advance my career. Everyone around me knows what a little bitch I am. They know this and they take advantage of it, yet I can never say no to any of these people. I'm this submissive little play-thing that people can toy around with whenever they want, because they know I will always say yes, in fear of conflict arising.  I can be bullied into doing anything. 

I have no friends, I have no one to talk to. My family only shames me as a failure if I bring up even a tiny portion of what goes on in this weak brain of mine.  it's for these reasons that I hate myself. I do not want to commit suicide. I want to murder myself. I want to murder myself like a killer murders another being. I cannot stand being trapped in this pathetic brain and body of mine any more. I hate my being so much and I want this all to end. There is no future in sight for me. My health is rapidly deteriorating thanks to winning the genetic lottery by taking all the shitty genes from my parents (extremely high blood pressure, heart problems, joint issues) and if I don't end it now, this body will probably crap out on me by age 32.

I'm rambling at this point, but I'm stuck in this body and mind that I hate so much but I am too much of a coward to follow through. The urge gets stronger every day though. More and more I find myself doing stupider things. Despite wanting to, I cannot kill myself because of my cowardice, but I no longer look when I walk through cross walks, I no longer look to even see if the pedestrian light is lit up. I just want to die, I want this miserable existence that is me to be erased off the face of this earth. Nothing of value will be lost, my family will be proud that I took the initiative to accomplish something meaningful in this life of mine by ending it, and the world will move on. I have no immediate plans yet, but the only thing that keeps me going is that some day, some how in the near future I will die. it sucks to be trapped guys... Thank you for reading.

"Life is terrible 

*rambling  nonsense, talk about my goddamn life, beware. I'll probably delete this  post. Will decide later. Excuse my grammar and some language butchering. originally posted onn* r/self

At  least that's what I see everywhere around me. Starting with my own  family. My mother is unhappy with her life she has put her life at risk  at least twice, she cries to the point of getting to a state of shock  and the rest of the time she pretends she doesn't care and goes out to  forget and enjoy despite everything and everyone. She's had it rough  growing up with her father dying from a brain injury for working as a  Boxer to barely bring food to the table, she was responsible for her 6  brothers and sister, she was going to marry someone she loved but left  her  in the  altar, she later married for real years later only because  of ""female"" peer pressure with a man that that she only knew as a  coworker, they didn't date, just straight up marry. Later in she had me  and my brother just barely since she was getting old by that time.  Worked her ass out to get us to a good school but she had to abandon us  and sometimes she would get mad and hit us for not getting good degrees.  She doesn't remember anything about it.

My  father. Just yesterday he was puking in the bathroom for so much  alcohol. He's a good man but he's fucked up. Doesn't talk much about his  past but I know he lived in even more poverty that my mother. One day  he said he and his family had a patch of terrain were they lived in a  makeshift room made of metal sheets and wood planks, their bathroom was a  hole in the ground and he sometimes had to look for food in the trash.  He never knew his father. He saw once a man get his throat sliced and  killed in front of him. He has incredible luck in general, which I don't  really know what to think about. He likes cartoons and old black and  white movies with a famous comedian here in my country, is not  interested in watching much else, which would be good but it has  affected how he interacts with the world (?). This one is hard to  explain but if you have ever seen Back to the Future, the first scene  where Marty is having dinner with his family; or in The Simpsons where  Bart writes something in the back of  Homer's head and he wants to see  what it says and cannot see, starts spinning around, everyone laughing,  until they realize is not funny anymore and instead is just sad. Well  that. The feeling of everyone knowing what he cannot see, the  uselessness of doing anything because nothing can be done or said, the  embarrassment. Because it doesn't just stays as something that he likes,  he acts it out in real life like his life is a comedy... Anyway, he is  overweight, alcoholic and always has had suicidal ideation because he  never has enough money, mostly, even if we now live good enough thanks  to their efforts but when he was working and earning good money he never  saved a cent and now what the pension gives him is just enough. He  doesn't have family and the ones that last are terrible people that has  gone to jail and normally just come to him for money. He would invite  them sometimes and show off what he has to them. Nothing to be worried  about. He has never physically touched me, as in grab hands to even pass  coins to buy something, or hug.

My  brother. At some point he just stopped talking to me. I don't know why  but I feel like he considers me an annoyance even if I barely talk to  him. And maybe he's right. Just like me he just wants to get out of the  house as soon as possible but cannot make enough money to sustain  himself, same like me. He's a big fellow. He was bullied in school for  that of course. At some point he became a bully himself, which made him  an aggressive person in general. He's always been someone very distant.  Once or twice I've physically hurt him in fits of anger. He's sexist  too. We had to saved him from a kidnapping with gun in hands. He has  destroyed 2 or our cars, never played a cent for it. To what he thinks I  don't know. I don't know him that well even when I see him daily and  lives with us.

My uncles and aunts all  are in terrible condition. One has had cancer treatment but she cannot  move or eat normally because of the same treatment, they ""burned"" and  destroyed her to try to cure her, no shady methods or anything, it's  just how the treatment goes. Another appears to have a good successful  life but his daughter hates him, she studied hard to be psychologist and  is working as a kinder teacher barely making it. Her daughter's  daughter ran away from her home because they fought too much and is  working as a nurse, his son was schizophrenic and  died hit by a truck,  his spouse died a month  later of sadness. The aunt I wrote about, her  daughter has a child with autism that, and it's going to sound terrible  but it's true, came to ruin their already broken family. Her husband is  struggling with stress, it caused half of his face to get paralyzed  and doctors told him ""don't get stressed of your face will fell off"", or  something to that effect. Another one is a complete sociopath. The  story goes that He burned the cat of one of my other aunts alive and  laughed as it was running in pain. Why he did it? Because he was jealous  of it. Once it died he cooked it and gave it to my aunt to eat it not  knowing it was her own cat. My friend. He is unhappy with his marriage.  Married only because of social pressure. His friend, she had a tumor on  her brain and is now paralyzed. I could tell you about my coworkers or  just anyone and they are not good. Even my own cat, I rescued it from  the garbage where someone had thrown her away in a bag.

Me.  Well... as far as things that had happened to me I'm ""lucky"" to be  alive, at least 4 times lucky. As I posted in other occasions I still  find really funny and terrible/scary that I know what human flesh taste  like because of a real life Sweeney Todd like person from whom I used to  bought food not knowing why they tasted so good... at least. For a time  I saw my grandfather, adoptive father of my father, go from being  healthy to have help his second wife to carry his pretty much skeletal  body to bath him in a small tube. He was easy to carry since he was so  light. They tried to do everything to cure him, he wanted to live. My  grandmother died a slow violent death too. In her bed but it looked to  me like one of her organs finally exploded and she vomited blood until  she passed out cold. My father wasn't present, he didn't wanted to see.  I'm a bag of mental issues. Thanks to my parents I don't lack anything  material, but I'm a piece of shit because I'm fucking old and I can't  get a decent job even with my studies because i can't talk to people.  I'm pathetic. I don't share my feelings or thoughts to anyone. I'm  quite. I like to listen. And people talk to me.

All  people around me are sad or crazy, they are barely living, have  terrible things happen to them with lasting effects. Even if many of us  are living, working, some in the city, some in other places, some with  money and all commodities, some joining some kind of mafia; we are all  not ok in the slightest. Some will try to be like ""well there's a lot to  be happy about"", ""I'm grateful for what I still have"", "" things will  get better""... I'm not sure about that. I respect their view point  but... Reality is kind of shitty. And, well, they don't really believe  themselves because it hurts them and prefer to not think about it  telling themselves otherwise. It's so hard. It's so much bullshit. And  it's normal. It's so... OK. It's just how it is. The world is beautiful  but living it is a coin toss.

No matter  what you do, no matter what you try, no matter who you are; something is  there to get you and make everything fall apart.

There's  nothing you can trust. Not even morally. If it's not you it's the  neighbor or... nature that wants to kill you. There's nothing else you  can do but to just be yourself, whatever that implies. Because you will  end up being just another story. Good or bad, terrible or endearing; it  doesn't matter.

Why are we even here but to delude ourselves into thinking there's some meaning to our suffering. *Why are we here... Just to suffer* (haha! Aaahhhh... What an idiot). We just keep going and we don't know why.

I  don't know if I should just let myself go, you know? Abandon everything  and just enjoy what I have right now without any kind of worry. Ran out  of money, be happy and then die early by my own hand. It's just another  story among others after all, is not even going to be half of what  anyone is going to remember. So bad that not everyone agrees and I  wouldn't like to hurt anyone... I could very well do the same as  everyone. Get drunk, go party, tell everyone to fuck off even if they  don't deserve it, do whatever I need to be functional, do an oopsie  every now and then and shrugged it off. But I care too much.

Who knows. In the end why would it matter.",suicidal,high

"I took pills and I'm dyingHey 

&amp;#x200B;

So I have been having problems for so long. I have a mental illness (depersonalization/derealization). It greatly diminishes cognitive abilities. I had a traumatic experience when I was young. I am a homosexual and my dad tried to kill me when he suspected that i might be a homosexual. I didn't understand why i felt that way, but now I do. It doesn't matter though because I couldn't solve anything. I isolated myself for over a decade and that caused all kinds of mental problems. Anyway, I talked to my dad about changing my major in collage some years ago, and he refused to let me leave engineering. With my mental illness, there was no way that I was going to succeed. I just couldn't comprehend anything and I was failing, so I changed my major without telling him. I told him that I was doing alright in collage. At the beginning of this semester my dad was having money problems and was losing his mind over it. So I told him I was graduating this semester, which was a lie. I have one more semester to go. Now, the semester is over and he thinks i'm going to get my degree in a few days. Now, nothing is resolved. Not my sexuality, nothing. There's no way out. I'm fed up with everything. So I took 25 pills of paracetamol at once. The google search said I would see the symptoms after 24 hours, but it's been less that 2 hours and I'm already seeing the symptoms. Now, I feel so dizzy and I'm vomiting. I'm sorry if I'm not making much sense, that's because I can barely concentrate. I feel so dizzy. 

Anyway, it just hit me that I might be going to hell. And I'm realizing how sad and shocked my mother and sisters and brother are going to be. And let me tell you, it's terrifying. 

I'm not sure what to think and what to do. I know I don't want to stay alive because there's nothing that I want. My problems are more than I could handle. 

What do you think guys. I think I'm absolutely losing my mind.

"Hell yeah I made two best friends ... with like 2 weeks left of school to go.

But genuinely, even though we're being seperated entirely, I think that, even after only 3 days, we'll actually stay in touch. I'm so close to these guys after only ever meeting them for like 18 hours or something, and like, idk 

We're all so closely connected it's crazy. To call our friendship unlikely is an understatement. I'm so glad I met them.

I guess they also brought out a part of me that even I didn't know. It's hard to explain but after spending almost 12 uninterrupted hours with them I feel like my personality has changed so much.

Also now everyone hates me just because I'm friends with the 'weird kids' but they're so nice to me omg like they don't compliment people that much. I've observed them because they're interesting people, and like I've never seen either of them compliment anyone unprompted but now they're telling me how likeable I am and holy shit I love them so muchh

tl;dr I literally met the best people

edit: idk I crave complimenting them to the internet so I'll continue: literally these guys are the most accepting people I've ever met. And our friendship is so lighthearted. Like we can make dumb sex jokes or keep all away from them. We all rarely talk about relationships and I love that, but the way that we do in those rare occasions makes me feel so welcome, like one of the lads talks alot (when the conversation is on relationships) about how accepting he is of gay people. I feel so fucking comfortable around them and they're actually fun people omg. And we (I) got into a bunch of fights yesterday and the day before just for being myself and they keep defending me and already people think we're in some weird love triangle and were yelling that we were gangbanging several times in the past two days and these guys are just so capable of laughing it off, and to be honest these allegations are fucking hilarious like one time we were vibing with me like 2½ metres away from one of them and like 3 metres away from the other and people were accusing us for somehow participating in making out in a three-way. And like the way we talk, like idk with a *lot* of people I get weird desires but with these two I literally don't even have to fight the idea of a romance because the idea isn't even there because it's so lighthearted. They're really open with me about insecurities and I love that-- not because it makes them vulnerable but it gives me the sense that others feel that way in *real* life and they told me that they basically trusted me more than anyone else (they said they trust each other, and myself, and one of the guys said about how he trusts his dad alot too) and I just LOVE THEM SO MUCHHJ",normal,low

I saw an account that I couldnt recognize (she changed her account details a day or so before that) and dm'ed her. We chatted about random shit for a bit and then the topic of the last movie I watched was brought up. After some digging I remembered [this masterpiece](https://youtu.be/soXkFMO4ixI) was the last movie I ever watched so I sent it to her. She found it funny and I thought it was a good idea to explain how homosexual aliens killed all women on earth to make everyone gay to save the planet to her because frankly I was too sleepy to think about it beforehand. I explained every single detail of the movie to her for about 25 or so minutes and then I decided to check our message history and found out she was not an ordinary online friend but an irl classmate.

"Don't know what else is left to doI've been experiencing really intense suicidal thoughts for a while now. It started after I transferred to a new school and made 2 really good friends, my ex david and and a girl named riley. We were all really close, but come January, David dumped me and riley transferred to a different school a city away within days of eachother. Needless to say, I was crushed and have entered a depressive state ever since then. It took a while to get over, especially because my ex insisted on being friends immediately after the breakup, which made it that much harder to get over him. Additionally, my ex had suicidal thoughts, so I spent most of the relationship convincing him not to kill himself. I made some new friends, but when coronavirus struck in March, I wasn't close enough to them to stay in touch. Right now, I'm in a position where I literally have no friends to talk to. I still talk to riley, but she transferred back to her old high school, and is now closer with her old friends. I didn't know her too long, so that makes staying in touch kinda hard. 

I was in a super bad place for a while, but staying home kind of cleared up my head. That was, until I had to deal with my parents full time. It was as if I had traded all my social issues for family ones, and I felt like there was nothing I could do to escape this sadness that was slowly engulfing me. 

However, I tried to use this as an opportunity to reach out to friends from my old high school, and my old best friend lila who I had fallen out of touch with. For a while, things seemed to be getting better again, and I truly felt like there was someone who genuinely cared about me. However, my anxiety persisted and the thoughts came back. I started thinking of ways to actually do it: firearms, hydrogen sulfide, suffocation by nitrogen, carbon monoxide poisoning. The fact that I could only think of one person who would care if i died didnt help. 

Right now I think I'm at my breaking point. School is about to start, I've been isolated for months, I'm behind on college applications, I'm taking on a huge workload this year, and I only have 1 friend. What's worse is that I got really wasted with lila a week ago and confessed everything, my depression, suicidal thoughts and plans on how to do it. She was sober, and I'm sure she was really freaked out, but I remember making her promise that she wouldn't tell me anything when I was sober if I didn't remember. Of course, I woke up remembering everything and felt awful. I scared away my only friend and set this awful burden on her. I pretended like I blacked out and she just said that she loved me. Since then, she's been acting kind of cautious around and me and I can't help but think that I've ruined my only stable relationship. My parents are toxic as hell, and I know from my past suicidal experiences, that telling them would only make things worse and for sure drive me to killing myself, as things have never been as bad as they are now. I think I'm really close to doing it and now have the resources to do it as well. I just don't know what else there's left to do.",suicidal,high

Im not going to post the long story to save people's time so that they can get to others who need help (although I can if anyone's interested) but I really need help controlling my thoughts. Basically, my roomate and his brother sent their friends after me as stalkers for a few weeks and didnt tell me it was them. This fucked me up for obvious reasons but also because my roomate made himself into everything I had at the university I go to. I didnt have many friends and he basically forced all his friends and activities upon me while using me for all of it (as he was an Alpha male and I'm a simple introvert). 

I got depression and anxiety for a bit, though I seemed to have beat it last semster. However, its come back hard now that I've returned from summer and all my thoughts are consumed by my roomate and his brother trying to torment me. I know these are my own thoughts and not them but they are driving me crazy and are almost constant which is starting to drive me towards suicide as an option at a quickening rate.

"Offer: A PenppalI'll start with this: I have been in your shoes before.

If you're here, chances are something is really bothering you. Maybe you don't know who to turn to, maybe you don't have friends that you can trust revealing information about your health. Maybe you just want someone to talk to, but you want it to be someone that doesn't know you at all.

I've walked the same line before, and I know how shitty it can be. I am humbly offering a listening ear and  friendly advice to anyone that wants a penpal to write to.

Writing can be extremely therapeutic. Writing to another person can be all the better: sharing stories, experiences, and advice is something I value highly, and I feel that a lot of people that come here could benefit from it. Personally, I love writing to people and I am always looking for someone to talk to. You can be as anonymous as you would like to be--I won't even ask for your real name if you don't give it to me. All I ask is that you send me a PM with your email and as much as you would like to tell me about yourself.

I'm offering a helping hand to whoever may want it. If you want a friend, I would be happy to be one. This offer extends to anyone that may want it, just please send me a PM with your email (reddit account works fine, too--whichever you prefer) and I will send you a letter shortly thereafter.

I hope this finds someone that is really just looking for someone to talk with. I've lived a pretty crazy life so far (I'm sure you would find some of my stories pretty amusing) and, like I said, I have had battled my own big, crazy brain before.

"I don't want to commit suicide, but I feel like it's my only real option. Is there any other solution you guys can think of?I'm in a weird situation. I don't want to commit suicide, but I feel like it's the only option I have. It seems like the logical thing for me to do.

Long story short, I'm gay. I know, nothing new. I know there are thousands of people who are going through the same thing, and I wish I could make everything all okay for them if I could. 

The way I see it is this. If God exists, I'm probably going to Hell. That's what I hear from people anyway. So, what's the point of delaying the inevitable? Might as well just get it out of the way since I'm doomed anyway. 

If God doesn't exist, then I still can't be happy. My family and friends would disown me or be unsupportive. Plus, I already stand out from other people too much due to other things. I don't want to come out and have my sexuality be another thing that will make me different and disconnected from people. 

I don't really have any hope. I really don't want to commit suicide because it breaks my heart that suicide is even a thing. It's heartbreaking that other people feel enough difficulty, pain, or hopelessness to do that.

But with me, I feel like I have to. I really don't want to do it, but what else can I do? I don't want to hurt my family. I know they'll be heartbroken, and I know it'll stay with them for years and years. 

I just wish I was straight. I hate the fact that the world is so divided over small things. All these things that people discriminate over are so fucking stupid. Racism, sexism, homophobia, etc. It's all ridiculous. But it exists. Why can't people just be kind to each other?

Does anyone have any advice? Maybe any tips on how to develop feelings for guys? I'd appreciate it. I think my best hope at the moment is to try and ""become straight"". I don't know if it'll work, but other than, suicide, it's my only other idea.",suicidal,high

"Two WeeksI've got my method lined up, but put aside for now.  Only thing I'm not sure of in regards to that is location...I don't think I want to force my parents to clean up my brains, but I haven't decided on another place to do it.

I feel hopeless, and I'm giving myself two weeks to find some hope - as is, things look bleak.  I'm way overweight and I can't stay motivated enough for long enough to do anything about it.  I'm ugly as fuck, but there's nothing I can do about that.  I feel like I'll always be alone, and my history validates that belief (anyone who has, for some unknown reason, cared for me...I've run off and made hate me - nowadays, though, no one seems to have any reason to care for me anymore).  I don't need today to remind me that no one wants to be with me, and no one will ever want to be with me, and I've accepted that years ago.  I'm consistently feeling worse, and my coping methods aren't working anymore (for example, I'm having to cut deeper and deeper to get the same release that near scratches gave me months ago).

I'm working a job I hate for people I don't like so I can make money to pay for shit I don't care about (student loans, car loan, etc), and it'll be 2 years before I have enough experience in my field to really go somewhere else, and until then I have little time for anything other than working and hating myself.

I can't even go to my best (only) friend about this...if I told him how I'm doing, I know 100% for a fact that within a couple hours I'd be dead or in an emergency room, because he'd feel obligated to call someone to keep me from dying...at least if I'd be dead, he'd finally see he's better off without me as a useless friend anyways.

Outside of that one friend, I have my parents...I'm just a burden on them, a useless 23-year-old who can't even be self-sufficient and instead relies on his parents for food, shelter, etc.

I'm really just tired of fighting depression and trying to do well when I have nothing to show for it - after a decade of fighting it, I'm more alone than ever and like I have even fewer choices, and am altogether worse off...I'm tired of being a pathetic excuse for a person, and if I can't find a reason to be alive by the end of the month...I don't think I will be.

"Life In quarantine4 years ago I was arrested and was put on probation for nearly 3 years. I dealt with depression as well as a cocaine addiction along with a break up I was going through. Life never seemed to be so dark for me. I spent many nights alone drinking alcohol and stuffing my nose making bad choices and waking up with regret on my mind. The toll of everything weighing on my brain and negative thoughts always made me consider taking my life but never got the strength to do it. The day I was released from probation I experienced the first bit of happiness I had felt in YEARS. It took me some time to get over my previous relationship but addiction still has a grasp of me. Although I don’t use as much as I used to I still do occasionally but am in a much better place than I was years ago. However, during this quarantine period I’ve seemed to slowly fall back into this dark hole I once was being slowly killed by. I haven’t worked in weeks. I’ve been at home with the same routine, wake up, force the same ol breakfast down and watch tv/ play video games. It’s starting to get to me. I can’t take being stuck inside .. the little bit of happiness I used to have is slowly leaving me and I’m drained. All my friends have their own life’s to live and well family isn’t always the easiest to talk to.. but even then... I don’t want to talk. I just want everything to go back to normal. Had to get this off my chest just in case some of you are feeling the same during these times. Please stay strong and remember it will be over, hopefully sooner than later.

I’ve dragged my family down with my depression, anxiety and suicidal thoughts for over ten years - since I was fourteen and I have never gotten better. This past year, I developed a bad eating disorder and as a result, basically everybody in my life (all my family, friends, boyfriend, and my boyfriends family) were burdened more with worry, begging me to get help. I was so ready to die but my 14.9 BMI wasn’t low enough. A while ago, I had promised my dad I wouldn’t commit suicide and I thought this maybe could be a loophole. However, I failed and I’m back to a 16.7 BMI.

I can't do customer/food service type work because of my medical issues, and that's why I'm just a full time student. I'm constantly working to try to keep my GPA between 3.5 and 4.0 to maintain grant funds for rent, bills, etc. 

We've been starving for over a week because my partner's bank info was stolen, and the bank said they could refund it, but that it would take half a month or so. We don't receive any grants until the 12th, so we're just wasting away. Yes I have tried the food bank in our area, and they think a small bag of already rotting fruit and a loaf of stale bread would be enough for us for a week. 

I can't even seek good emotional or mental help; I've tried calling hotlines and they either keep me on hold until the call drops or they never even answer. I've tried seeing an ""emotional counselor"" (that's what my insurance will pay for) but she's extremely dismissive of my feelings and wants to rush me out the door so that she can see the next person early. I'm on antianxiety/antidepressants medication, but they literally have me on the smallest starting dose and she refuses to consider that I might need it increased. 

I'm afraid of someone finding out how emotionally fragile I am right now and having me sent somewhere, because I would be dropped from all my classes and lose my apartment bc I'd be unable to pay rent.

i didn't wanna bother you with this and wont be sending any more messages after this, you can stop reading now and delete this if you want, its ok.
I wanted to say this to someone and since you kind of know me i'll say it to you, i get the emotional charge that would come with and don't wanna pile to you day so i kind of hope you are not reading anymore and have gone about your day. There is some decent chance i won't be making through next week, i've tried to kill myself in november and failed, woke up with the regret of being alive knowing i wouldn't have it in me to try again for a long time, its been piling on since then and im getting the same feeling of hopelesness and desolace i had that day.
I'm so tired of pretending right now, all the fake smiles, fake laughs, fake conversations, if i have to fake one more smile or say that im ok one more time today im gonna break.
It's ironic i always considered myself so rational and logical and in the end its emotions and mental disorders taking it all from me, what i know and believe is so disconnected from what i feel and think it lost all importance, i know i'd have much to offer to a partner or a friend but all i can feel in social interactions is everyone is better of staying away from me, fake a smile and a plastic conversation and end it as quickly as i can, never real, never vulnerable, adding layers to protect myself and for as much as i logically want to break through them i can't, its so thick now its so much work and i'm so tired, i have failed to make a real human connection all my life and have never had a real friend or a real relationship, which seems to be what i crave the most, completely effortless for most people and even though it's the biggest source of my anguish i'm failing to do anything about it. I could say that logically i don't want it and would flick a switch to end the desire if i could but i understand all the ways it would effect my brain and in the end that's all there is
I Just wanted to be happy and i tried so hard for so long i don't know if i can keep trying, i set a lot of difficult goals i thought would make me happy and worked at it for years, i accomplished so much and now everything is worse because i feel the same and have all these things for nothing, everything seems to be for nothing and i'm lost.

"I'm giving life just one more chanceSorry for any grammar mistakes. I'm suck at grammar.

I have all my suicide notes written except for one that I need to do tonight that goes to my youth minister and his wife. I'm writing this to vent I guess. To see if there's anything still worth living for. I've tried to find something anything that's worth staying for. But I couldn't find anything, so I know my worth. 
My worth is nothing.

 I'm tired of not being good enough. I know I'm not good enough. Because I wasn't good for my former moms, the only people who actually treated me like a son. But I screwed that up cause I'm so stupid and worthless. I put all my value on them and cause mental strain on them so they had to leave me. Everything that they told me feels like such a big lie now. All it did was reinforce my mom issues, abandonment issues, and touch starved issues. I want someone to hold me and give me affection like they did. I can't see anyone as family anymore cause if I do I feel like they're just gonna leave just like my moms did. I miss them so much. I just want a actual mom. 

 I'm not good enough for other people. I had a crush on a girl who we'll call Sophya, and Sophya liked me back. So we talked more and she told me that she wasn't ready or mature enough for a relationship. Which was fine with me and I told her to do what's best for her. But guess what she does next? She goes and dates my one of my best friends. She said that she liked both of us. But ultimately she ended up with him. It not even that I wish she would get together with me. It's the fact that she told me that she wasn't ready and told me no then got together with someone who I thought I could trust and wouldn't hurt me. That literally tells me that I'm not good enough for others.

All I ever do is upset my friend group. I don't deserve them. I'm so openly suicidal with them and joke all the time about how I want to die and kill myself. They get upset with about how much I talk about it. Which is fair. But it's just a cry for help but they don't seem to notice. That's not their fault in anyway I should just be honest with them and that's on me. I understand that. I swear I'm the worst friend that they could have. I feel like they just hang out with me out of pity cause I'm not good enough. I don't deserve them.

Finally, I come to my youth minister and his wife. I've always been close to my youth minister since the 7th grade and I'm a senior now. So he's gotten to see me go through junior high and high school. He's filled the dad role in my life. Since my actual dad never really gives me any attention. I've only grown close with his wife over the past year. She always just been a trusted adult that I could go to if I needed any advice. As she's a very logical person. Since my moms left me I've been looking at her to fill that mom role in my life and she haven't. I shouldn't except out of her as she not the type to do that. The only people that I can think of who would miss me would be them as they been apart of my life for 5 years. But I know I'm just a disappointment in their lives. My youth minister says he see me as his son but again, I'm just one big disappointment so I feel I let him down a lot. I wish I could live with them and have a better support system then what I actually do at home. My dad and my stepmom don't care about me or what happens in my life. But I'm so afraid that they're just going to leave me. I haven't spoken with them for awhile and I feel like if I kill myself now I don't have to deal with the pain of them leaving me. 

I hope you enjoyed reading about what is the mess of Max's life. I plan of killing myself when the next time my parents are out of the house. I'm gonna go buy some pills and overdose. I have nothing to live for. I'm done. I'm worthless and no one will care when I'm gone.",suicidal,high

"I bought the gunI'm a 23 year old man and I am going to kill myself at midnight (or 11:59 - i haven't decided my DOD yet). I have a small penis, and have been turned down by many guys because of it. Every day I am ashamed by it, ever since high school I have been dpressed because of it, and I have come very close to killing myself - this is the 7th time, and I'll do it right. It's something I could never fix aside from killing myself. and I have always fantasized about suicide, even since I was in primary school. I don't have any saved records of being mentally ill (thank god I never pulled any big stunts before) so my background check was clear and I bought the gun.

I also (almost finished) bolted the door to my bedroom, AND (ditto) the door to my Bath room, so there are 3 hard things keeping anyone away from my body. I have about 60mg of Xanax, and some phenobarbital sitting in the cupboard. I bought a big container of vodka to wash it down. Those are in case I chicken out. Then I'll shoot myself, maybe cut myself a little bit to ease any anxiety.

Any preparation ideas? Not sure what else I should do other than the will. Wipe my computers? idk

"sometimes i wish i had the strength to just end my lifei keep telling myself to stay alive because i don’t want to make anyone upset.

my boyfriend of over a year dumped me. my best friend in the entire world gets annoyed with me at the drop of a hat. my art teacher who is so important to me just sees me as a lazy, burnout failure. my sister is more successful than me, a 17 year old, at age 14. all i do is guilt trip my mom apparently, cost my family money, and make their lives a living hell. i’m fat, i’m ugly, i’m stupid, and im shit at the things i love to do.

so the only reason i am still alive is because i am a coward. i cannot find the strength to do the world a favor and just end myself. even though i fantasize about a world without me, i cant bring myself to kill myself. i can’t even hurt myself, i’m that much of a coward.

"My boyfriend left me a year ago and I want to kill myselfI know the tile sounds really needlessly dramatic but there is a little more to it than that. 

Basically, my mum and dad sacrificed a lot to give me a good childhood and a stable home life. I love them a lot and I've always been aware that they fought through a lot so that I can be happy more or less in place of them. Five years ago I met my ex-boyfriend and we were a couple for three years and have been broken up for a year. This was also the time I spent at university and since I live in a university town it's a very big deal, it's hard to find work here. 

Things with my boyfriend weren't good for about a year and a half but I thought it was me neglecting our relationship in favor of uni. Then as soon as I had the brain space to really give our relationship everything he left me. That year and a half took a lot out of me. It was the most stressful time of uni, the people I was living with were awful and draining and he consistently took their side in disagreements which made me feel hopeless and alone. I have since realized he wasn't really giving much to our relationship either. I was not in a good place when I graduated. I joined an MA program so that I could salvage a bit of myself and feel like I got to be happy for at least a bit of this massive thing that I spent 27/37 grand on, not including loans. As soon as the program started he left, claiming a bunch of different reasons until settling on ""growing out"" of me. Now It's been a year and I have yet to cheer the fuck up.

Since then he has been around in my life, never cutting contact but it feels like he is bating me to do it. He will listen and be there in my worst moments so I am reluctant to let him go. Then later he will complain about that and how I haven't just ""gone to get medication"" for my issues, that he was instrumental in causing. I feel depressive and tired. It's an extension to the tired I felt post university. I also feel like I have spent the time I set aside for feeling myself again grieving about a relationship. I have been sad and exhausted for three years now and I have run out of will to go on.

Overall, I feel like two amazing people sacrificed their lives so that I could be happy and then I made so many mistakes that I'm not. I feel like I trusted someone with my happiness who didn't deserve it. I feel like I made friends who weren't really friends. And I feel like I wasted their efforts and 37 grand. I feel like my whole life was a waste, of the effort, of people much more deserving than me.

Mostly my confession is that I feel like I can't tell anyone. My Ex keeps saying he is there for me but I feel like telling him ""I want to kill myself every day as a direct result of your actions"" will be a manipulation. Telling my mum and dad will feel like ""all the effort you put into me was a waist."" My two friends are very up on their mental health advice and telling them will mean it very quickly spirals out of my control and I'll be talking to APS. 

So that's my confession. I feel hopeless but I can't tell anyone because there is either too much invested, too little invested or nothing invested despite promising having something invested. I have no idea what I'm doing but I feel like I just want to stop and I cant because it will upset everyone else.",suicidal,high

"I've lost more hope, which I didn't think was even possible.tl;dr - Question, can the crisis text line or suicide prevention hotlines call the police on you without you giving permission?

---

It's so weird. I really didn't think I could get any more depressed or hopeless than I had been in the past. For some reason I've been in a low point already with my depression and suicidal thoughts lately. Then I had a terrible doctor's appointment with super bad news that basically told me I have to suffer for the rest of my life. 

I have no one to talk to about any of my feelings besides my therapist. I feel like a burden to everyone, I can't stand talking about this stuff because I don't want to be a downer so I just wallow and suffer in silence most of the time. Even the people I know don't consider me a burden, like my therapist, I still convince myself in my head that I'm a burden to them and I can't stop myself.

Speaking of my therapist, I had a super depressing realization today. I was thinking about who would possibly miss me if I went through with it, or would I have a funeral for anyone to come to, and who would come if so? I think about this a lot, and I never come up with anyone except the few people in my health care team. Anyway, the new realization I had was, the only reason I haven't gone through with suicide yet is I'm afraid of how it'll make my health care team look... How messed up is that?? I love them so much, but I don't think I can keep suffering anymore just because of that fear.

I started writing them letters thanking them for everything they've done, and I also need to write one general ""F you"" letter to my so-called family.

Anyway, I had a super bad day obviously and I just want it all to be over. Like the tl;dr says I'm wondering if anyone knows if the crisis text line can call the police on you without your permission? Also, please please please don't give me platitudes or cliches, I've seen and heard them a hundred times and the ones I've been able to try haven't helped.

I'm looking to have them removed soon, but even at its soonest that'll be in like a month. I don't want any genitals, and if the surgery goes well I'll have nothing but a smooth crotch like a doll (with a hole for urine).

Currently I've been struggling with dysphoria a lot. I feel like I'm deformed, or like I'm constantly forced to dress up like a girl. Its like I have an open wound between my legs.

The other day I was on the subway and I bacame acutely aware of the fact that i had genitals and I was very aware of how it felt (I wasn't wearing underwear so this could just be the fault of my pants), it was incredibly painful and I couldn't even Express it because there were other people on the subway. And this is just one of many examples.

"Suicide Helpline's are the best and the worstLess than 2 weeks ago I was ready to die. I wrote a note, did my makeup nicely and chose the outfit to be my last. I was ready willing and able. I'm not going to put my method but anyway it was a way that when it came to it, full of adrenaline, I hesitated, and I knew that hesitation could leave me only injured instead of dead. I called a helpline, desperate, originally to give me the bravery to see my suicide through. But then I let them help me. I told them my location, the police turned up so quickly, I was taken by ambulance and locked up for 4 days and released a week ago. 
Funnily enough my problems haven't disappeared and today I started considering attempting again. I called the helpline. After all, they saved my life last time. 
This time? I told a woman on the phone that I want to overdose. She says: 
• You just have to fake it till you make it! 
• You just need to find something you really love! You haven't found your purpose yet! 
• What could you do to help someone else instead of thinking about yourself?
• When you have that thought that you want to kill your self, you just have to tell that thought to leave! 
• Have you considered doing a barista course? And then you could go work as a waitress. (At this point I was so WTF that I was just silent and not talking.) 
That would be something to look forward to, right! 

Lady, I didn't come for fucking career advice, how is the idea of one day becoming a waitress going to make me not kill myself right now. I don't want to be a waitress. I don't think any type of job would make me want to live. In fact when you are ready to die, talking to me about my future career is just going to make me even more determined. 

She asks, ""so what are you going to do with the rest of your day today?""
 ""I told you, kill myself."" 
""But... hasn't anything I've said been helpful at all?"" 
""I don't know."" 
(Sounding upset and offended) ""Haven't I said anything that's made you feel better?"" 
""This isn't about you.""
(Audible gasp) ""But it makes me feel like I'm not very good at my job!"" (Shaky voice like she's going to cry) 
""Seriously? Do you want me to comfort YOU right now?"" 
She starts breathing weird like she's going to hyperventilate and I don't want to deal with that shit. So I just hung up. 

Am I just a rude person? or is that woman not really the right person to be working on a Suicide helpline if she's going to get butthurt when her random life advice isn't going to talk a suicidal person off a ledge?

"Need to get some stuff outYesterday the guardian I mention often in my posts forced me to tear down a ceiling with them without any protective gear for my face or hands. No face masks or goggles or gloves, just a hammer and a putty knife to tear down part of a ceiling to replace it with plasterboard. 

I haven't been eating so I've been far too weak to do any manual work as of late but they say to me that I should do all the work I can because I'm a man and men do work. That I'm a girl and do no work. I don't hate the idea of being a woman or anything like that, but this person emasculates me at every turn and makes me feel like I'm not a man. I want to feel masculine (not like muscly and shit, just confident in my own character and being. Comfortable with who I am), but I get made to feel like dirt so much.

And they had me get all the dust and shit in my eyes and mouth and forced me to do all the tearing down on the ladder since ""I'm younger"". Then they had me hold up plasterboard for 10-15 minutes so they could fumble around and then nail it up (their definition of makeshift home repair btw), and I almost fainted from how fatigued and sick I felt. 

They then made fun of me and screamed at me for ""standing around"" even though there was nothing left to do while they put in the last few nails. They told me to go get the broom and I did. I asked if I could just sweep up the room myself (the room we did this in is going to be one I move into soon). Just one thing for myself. I haven't had any control over anything in my life at all. Not my love life, not my school life, nothing. I've felt so powerless. I just wanted one thing. To fucking sweep up some goddamn debris, alone, in my new room.

So they yelled at me and said I'm lazy and told me I have no work ethic. ""When you start a job, you finish it"". I was going to finish it. I just wanted to do it alone.

So they pick up the broom and begin sweeping themselves to make me feel like shit. Made me handle the dustpan and then swept the shit so fast that they got more dirt and dust into my eyes and mouth.

As soon as we had finished, I went and cried my eyes out. I cried so fucking hard. Just with all the old ceiling bits all over me and in my mouth, just crying. I'm an adult and I was reduced to worthlessness and crying by someone who's says they love me.

I come on my computer and go on Skype. My ex is on and says ""hey"". We talk for a bit, a fight starts, we fight pretty much the rest of the night. Same shit, different day.

This is my life. Living with an emotionally abusive person who controls my every move, surrounded by people who deeply fucking hate me.

I talked about all of what happened yesterday with some friends and some people I met on this subreddit. It was helpful and if any of you read this (doubtful), you did help. Don't mean to give that impression. I just keep thinking about all of it and I can't stop feeling like fucking shit.

Before you ask, no I can't stay with anyone else. No extended family would take me in. No irl friends. Gotta stay here and save money until I can possibly move out with an online friend in a few years (plans that will likely fall through). 

I have fucking nothing. 

Last night after everything went down, I did my first livestream in about 5 years (I used to stream on jtv back in the day) with some friends. Just a shitty game I bought in a Steam sale to play something. I usually screen share stuff on Skype for pals when we're just chilling in a Skype call or something, but this game couldn't be windowed, so I decided to just use obs and stream it on twitch. It was fun and I enjoyed it. First time I really have had fun doing something in about 3 months. Was considering making videos and streaming again to just have a hobby. Just cope in some way. Dunno was just thinking about it a bit after all was said and done.

Been dealing with emotional and verbal abuse for 10 years. Been suicidal for 6. Something's gotta fucking give, you know? Something's gotta look up somewhere.

"Why me?As a young kid, my father used alot of drugs. Abused my mother and always left us behind. My sister was 8 &amp; I was 6, when she started cutting into herselt. As a young boy, I didn’t understand the motive behind that. Why would such a beautiful girl do that to herself? She burned herself, cut herself &amp; multiple times in the hospital for an almost fatal suicide/overdose. I was young, so I thought this was normal. I started cutting myself at a really young age. Cutting the pain away, multiple suicide attempts, but never succeeded. Walked around with these questions I could not ask to no-one, because no one understands me. Still to this day, I feel worthless; craving for a little bit of happiness. Everyone leave’s me because I am nothing worth &amp; should have never born, but then I ask why; how can I not kill myself?

"You're eating chicken that your friend recommended for your birthday, and it's so good... *You're so busy eating chicken that you can't do anything else. Everything falls away: school, stress, social life, memes... all that is left, is chicken.*

*The more you consume it, the more it consumes you. What are words? All you know is chicken. There is no past, no present, no future, no here, no there. Just chicken.*

*Before you know it, you're bowing on the floor to the chicken gods, every time you cluck a live chicken magically appears and falls straight down your throat.*

*And you love it.*

*You grab a chicken as it's falling, you must bring others to the cure that is this delicacy. You tear the skin off your chicken and make ropes, and feed the people who you tie down with all the chicken they can handle.*

*And then some.*

*You've amassed an army of chicken eating fanatics, and you simply can't stop... and you don't want to. Now the chicken is in everything, every surface is covered in the blood and feathers of hundreds of poor fowls. You roll in the piles of chicken that has filled up all the pools and valleys in your city.*

*It's consuming the planet, every resource has been forgotten. All shelters are made of chicken bones and skin, every hunger quenched by the raw flesh of the birds, every thirst quenched by the rich blood of millions.*

The doctors saved you with seconds to spare.

You shiver at the horror of a nightmare you've just had.

"If I Tell Her, Will She Think I'm Pathetic?There's one woman I love, shes my best friend, she doesn't romantically love me back, and that's fine, we are still really good friends. But I want to tell her how I feel, what I have planned, just because in this cold mean world, shes the only one I feel I can trust.

She lives up in Canada, I live in the western part if the U.S., think of her as that cool kick ass rocker girl in high school, she has the makeup, the hair, the attitude, the looks, the suave. But shes in college, she has her own super stressful family issues, she has friends, so much to worry about.

I'm worried that if I try to talk to her she roll her eyes, sigh, and say, ""Really? Dude, I have more important shit to worry about.""

Realistically I know she would never say that, but she might think it.

Jm worried she'll see me as pathetic. 

Everything I've done, improve my lifestyle, work harder and longer hours, lose a ton of weight, all of it was for her, I love her, but more importantly I admire her, I look up to her, she inspired me, and until recently, was the sole reason why I kept going.

She is the greatest friend I have.

And I'm scared I'll let her down, I'm scared I'll show her how week I really am.

Im, hard set on my plan and although her not loving me back sucks, (alot) it isnt why I'm doing it.

I just hope she knows that she really was my world, she really was my inspiration, and I want her to know she changed my view on life.

I also want her to know that what I'm going to do isnt her fault.

What do I do?

Should I tell her? Should I talk to her?

If she told me not to I wouldn't, but I dont want to burden her with my emotional shit.

I love her too much for that.",suicidal,high

"Need help.I don't even know what to write here.  I guess I just hope writing it out and discussing it will make me realize how stupid wanting to die is.   

I'm 31 and bipolar.  My doc has been giving me lithium for only the past 3 years to treat it.  It has helped TREMENDOUSLY with being able to hold on to a job and a relationship.  I'm poised to finish and sell a start up website.  We are in a very nice niche market and have a celebrity endorsing it.  Basically, there is no reason I shouldn't be rich, or at least well off, fairly soon because of my efforts.  I have been with the same girl for 3 years and we are getting married in my home town this spring.  Yet here I am, thinking almost everyday for the past 10 months, that I want to die.  I think about this more then anything else.


I think my main problem is definitely stemming from the bi-polar.  It's not the ups and downs that get me now, it's the consistency that literally bores the life out of me.  Before I learned about my condition everyday was an adventure, for better or worse.  Work was exciting, creative, inconsistent, and sometimes volatile.  My women were very numerous.  Now everyday is the same and the is no adventure to life anymore.  The more committed I become to the people and and projects in my life the more I know what to expect everyday.  This makes me to die.

Now the ups and downs of undedicated life wasn't exactly a picnic either.  I'm 100% self destructive and ruin the life of anyone that cares to be part of my life.  

So i'm left with the choices:
a) Take the drugs and be bored for the rest of my life.
b) Not take the drugs and destroy my life but sometimes happy.
c) Die.

"I'm done trying.I've always been alone. I've always been unhappy. I've tried so hard to change it over the years and I can't find the motivation to keep trying. Being generous and caring is fruitless, being selfish only makes things worse. The only way to win is to keep to myself and continue to suffer.

Life isn't worth suffering over. Only the strong succeed and I've tried so hard to be strong but that's not who I am. I've accepted my inferiority complex as a fact of life and I can't deny what I am anymore. I feel more than I'm supposed to; I'm too sensitive. I'm naive. I'm a fool. I'm stupid. I'm unattractive. I'm never good enough. I'm constantly in fear. I'm constantly withdrawn. Living hasn't been comfortable in months.

There was a point when I was happy but it was gone as quick as it came, and I can never get it back. I thought I found someone who cared. I thought I found someone I could depend on, someone I felt safe with. Someone I could trust. Someone I could have fun and be happy with.

I depended on her attention too much. She was so good to me but I was so insecure, she found someone else to love and it hurt so much. I tried so hard to stay friends with her but I was filled with sadness, guilt, and self-loathing. It annoyed her, it hurt her. I felt so much but she didn't feel anything. Now we can't even be friends and that hurts the most.

But it isn't her fault that I feel this way. None of it's her fault. It's all my fault. If I had loved myself and been more confident and more interesting maybe I could have kept her attention and we could have at the very least stayed friends. But I was too greedy. I wanted someone to depend on, someone I could be intimate with for once in my life. I was selfish and I hurt her by hating myself and her leaving because of it was fulfilling the worst fear I've ever had.

I can't love myself. There's no way to rationalize it, there never has been, I've been in denial until now. I have nothing but hate for myself and there's nothing I can do to change that. I don't have the willpower anymore. I don't have any confidence anymore. I can't do it. I'm never going to be happy. I'm never going to love and be loved. I just want to fall asleep and never wake up. I'm always going to be stuck in isolation, trapped in neverending dripping thoughts and fears. Life has been nothing but horrible to me, there's nothing to look forward to. I go through failure after failure and I never get to know what it's like to truly get anywhere. I've done nothing but regress any achievement I thought I'd made. I have nothing anymore. Nothing.",suicidal,high

Some people are so insecure of the idea that someone doesn’t want to be around anymore... it just blows my mind. Suicide should be legal. It doesn’t always “get better”. We should have the option to take a drug and slip a way without botching ourselves or feeling tremendous pain. ",suicidal,high

"The society is a failure and nobody should be thankful for thatGreetings, to whom it might concern!

I am a 26-year-old male with a Master's degree on Biology.

My story begins with the cruel notion that my childhood as psychologist said were absent. I was beaten, yelled at quite often for no reason. Being constantly worried how should I behave was extremely stressful and the outcomes of my father doings were unpredictable. 

School was the same. I was constantly bullied and I asked help from my teachers. I mostly I got a subtle reply of I should stop whining or that they also have impossible dreams as wanting to be ""the queen of England"". 

Thus, I started to play computer games early on as an escape from reality. I played many online games and found friends. It was awesome because I always felt like I was useful - finding novel strategies and telling people what to do and how.

I graduated high school with good grades by not studying anything at the class room, I was just sleeping and before a test or an exam I just forced myself to study something within 10 to 20 minutes. I spend my time reading book and not talking to anyone, I havent even spoken to most of my classmates for 12 years.

Off to university, I was happy because I got to live alone with a scholorship. I only slept and studied everyday and not doing anything else. The only problem is that year by year, my memory, energy levels and motivation started to decline rapidly. As an example, going to store to buy food, I needed to rest for 5 to 10 minutes. Needing frequent naps during the daytime and sleeping 12 to 15 hours per day.

I went to a see a doctor asking about my problem, since I saw the other students had the energy to socialize, to study, to party, to work part time and were over all satisfied with their lives. My doctor told me that ""university is not for everyone"" and that her husband dropped out of university in the 5th year of studies. As depressing as it sounded, I went home and continued with my life.

I forced myself to exercise, eat more, take vitamins, fish oil and tried to socialize. I promised  that I would run everyday for 3-5 km, eat 2000 cal and go to sleep around 10pm. Forced myself to wake up and make myself some breakfast and go take a shower. I collapsed after 3 months of trying to this. I was really angry since the only thing that the internet says in trying to learn how to be happy is by exercising, healthy foods and socializing, apparently this is for people who have most of the things under control.

Fast forward, I finished my bachelor and started to work in Finland for 1,5 years to gather money for abroad studies. I went to work at 6 am in the morning and left 2 pm. Everyday after work I went to sleep (I was 22 at the time). After 1,5 years my boss told me that I work really good but he is really worried about my overall health - that I am too tired all the time and also I am not talking to anyone. After work, I always went to sleep and slept to the next day. On the weekends I just ate and binged youtube.

24, I went to see a doctor (another one) with the same issue, who concluded that I have depression. She did all the blood tests, checked my lungs and kidneys and for any vitamin deficiency. Everything was good. So, before me going to sweden, she gave me SSRI. It gave me psychosis within the first day. I was scared to take other antidepressants.

My studies in Sweden were even harsher, I was more tired than ever before and I was sent to a psychiatrist in Sweden. I was full of hopes that maybe a country that supposedly I more caring about their own citizens and should be smarted than most of other countries in the world, should know what they are doing. They gave me an SNRI that within 1 weeks gave me severe psychosis. For what ever the reason, they did not allow me to get in to the hospital for any treatment. I was hallucinating and delusion for 1 month and desperate for help, I flew back to Finland for a private psychiatrist, who gave me an antipsychotic. The medicine now just made me more sleepy and as disgusting as it might be, I peed in my bed since I couldnt hold it in due to the drugs relaxing effects.

I stopped taking all other medicines and went back to studing. I was hopeless and wanted to be normal like everyone else. I went to the classes, and there I was looked weirdly, since I didnt have energy to shave or take showers sometimes, I was also asked how does it feel to not have friends from my classmates or that how can a person like myself get into a masters program.

I finished, suprisingly if it wasnt for my supervisor, but as she noticed my memory was really bad, my focus was almost absent and the only thing that saved me was that I already knew a lot.

I now ask you guys, why shouldnt I do suicide? I have not had a normal day in my life ever since I was child, I do not know how to be happy, I desperately looking for options from the internet but NOTHING no advice for my condition except FIND A DOCTOR. The doctors so far who I have a lot in my life havent done anything.  I want to work with my doctors, I am willing to cooperate and be as friendly as possible to fix this, but no one wants to help...

Everyday ever since I was 8 has been painful - headaches, fatigue, chest pain, chronic fatigue and no enjoyment of nothing. I kept on going with the idea that ""IT WILL GET BETTER"" idea, obviously it won't. I can not go to work nor socialize since I do not even have energy to go the toilet. Nobody has not taken me seriously and I am deemed as a ""loser"" and ""lazy"".

Why should I continue ?

P.S - I do not answeres like ""pls continues"", ""life is precious"" etc. 

I want an answer that explicitly tell me that why should I and people like me continue and what should we do to get help or help ourselves (tips etc). 

If I dont get help, then suicide is the only option.",suicidal,high
"What kind of measures does your school take against Covid-19? I'm curious to see what do schools in the US or other countries do to prevent contamination. For mine, they test our temperature at the entrance, then they tell us to use the disinfectant that you dispense with your foot. Having a mask is mandatory too.

They also divided our class (21 students) into two groups, e.g, my group is called 1st Bac/D, and it's divided into D1 (11 students) and D2 (10 students), when D1 is at school from 8:30 to 12:30, D2 is online, and in the evening from 3:00 to 5:00, they switch. The next day, the group that was online in the evening stays online, and it goes on... This is a method that all private schools here use, public schools don't even care lol (btw don't mind the weird schedule we have, Morocco doesn't make sense).

As for when someone has Covid-19, which happened in my class, we have to stay online for 10 days, and can only enter school after that period if you did a test and brought the results. They told me to go back home because I didn't have it lmao.",normal,low

"Terrible with Snapchat, what to do with my crush/advice please? Hey everyone, 19 here, I feel like all you younger kids have grown up with snap so you know what to do/what stuff means. I got it 2 years ago and barely used it until now.


So I’m terrible with Snapchat and have a streak with my crush for 30 days now. I barely use snap so normally I never have streaks longer than 2-3 days, and usually don’t snap at all. This is the longest one I’ve had. We don’t just send pics, we’ve had a conversation every snap with flirting here and there, she’s called me cutie and told me that like she’s not like the other girls etc, and agreed to meet up but I never planned a specific day, and she’s wanted to come over to my place but I got nervous... yeah I know that’s on me.


So normally we snap the entire day and she will respond in 5-15 min maybe an hour tops, I usually respond fast but sometimes I take longer like 3 or 4 hours but she usually responds fast. However, today is the first time I’ve been left on delivered for more than an hour, it’s at 4 hours currently and her snap score has gone up like 100 points since then so she definitely saw it. What’s that suppose to mean? Is she not interested now/upset? I don’t think I’m suppose to double snap, right? Never had to do that before. She is honestly the most beautiful person out there, every guy at my school would and is probably trying to go after her so I’m not sure if I messed up I’m so bad w snap. Any advice/input? Thanks a bunch",normal,low

but i don’t know if i’m cut out for it.

i’m empathetic to the point where it hurts me. i feel what the other person is feeling. i cry reading everyone’s posts, and although i do want to die and have tried, only a few things/people are keeping me here. 

i have a two kitties who i love to the ends of the earth. i can’t leave them, they’re my babies. the thought of leaving them is making me cry as i type this. 

my partner has told me that i’m his reason for holding on, too. i can’t betray him like that. i love him so, so much. he’s already helped me with EDs and my cutting, so if i die, that would have been for nothing. i can’t do that.

my little sister. she’s autistic, and i don’t trust the kids at her school to be as nice to her. she sees the good in everything. what would she think if her big sister never came home from her second year of college? 

so all i can do is cry about things i have no control over. i’m stuck.

"Anyone seem to always have that inevitable day or two through the week or month that bring these thoughts on?I seem to be there. And it seems to be a very real phenomenon for me. Just for whatever reason it'll hit me that I'm miserable and I'll want to get away. The problem is is that on the days that I'm happy I feel in the back of my mind that I ought to be depressed. I should be feeling down. 

When I'm feeling like garbage, I truly feel at home if you will. I feel this is right. This is how you should feel. This is normal. This is natural. And I'll just sort of sink into this feeling as I'm doing now. A numbness sort of comes on and I feel like a radio station turned to static. I  feel completely lethargic. Almost like I'm meditating on emptiness. I could feel worse. I could feel better. I just want to sink into this misery further though. Like receding into my own mind. 

I think about falling and what that slight instantaneous moment as you hit the ground is like. There has to be a brief instant where you feel something. Probably like what it's like when you fall in a dream. You get that intense rush and then bang! You're awake. I can almost swear that I do feel something in those dreams. I bet that's what it's like. 

I kind of have a fear that once you die you immediately go into another form of existence. Like when you fall and ""die"" in your dream and wake up. Fuck that. I don't want to press my luck. I don't want a double or nothing. I want it to be over.

In general I'm not telling anyway unless it really matters and it would be a gain in some way or the other. Not because I don't trust the community members close to me but because I don't want to be that guy. And IMHO it doesn't and shouldn't matter but sadly some people are funky about that.

"What are your guys thoughts on the asian american hate crimes in recent news. Recently I stumbled upon a recent news article which was covering attacks on asian americans and I just found it horrible how teenagers we're taking part in these hate crimes as recently a Thai man in his 80's was shoved for no apparent reason and later died due to brain trauma. These action were later taken as not a hate crime since in the words of the defendant's lawyer ""the man was wearing a mask and a hat therefore it's impossible for it to be a hate crime"" this just seems wrong seeing as any unjustified attack should be considered a hate crime.

"I wish there weren't consequences.I didn't know where to post this. I feel like the worst version of myself for even coming here, for consciously looking up these kinda of forums (is that correct terminology? I mean I know they're called 'subreddits' but I'm not a regular user so pardon the lack of knowledge) I feel like I'm ruining myself by enabling these parts of me. And this isn't to shame people. I can't shame anyone for wanting to die. I can't act appalled or disturbed by an act of self harm or destructive behaviour because I know. I know feelings—whatever happens in our heads that makes every emotion so heavy and real—are complicated. I know this is all shit. I know that even though not everyone feels this way, every breath I take is harder than the last one I took. And I know that maybe there are things to look for in my future. That I should hold on. That this doesn't have to define the entirety of my being. But I am so tired. And not in the way that I've told myself for four years. Not in the way where I just want to sleep it all  away and avoid my life completely. I am tired of trying and arguing with my own head about why I can't die. Why it's wrong. Why I have to hold on. I'm tired of having to think of the consequences. Maybe it helps. Maybe it's essential because at least it ties me back to reality. But really. Isn't enough, enough? Why can't I hurt myself without the guilt of knowing my own self destruction affects other people too. God it frustrates me so much. I don't want to be a victim. I don't want people to feel sorry for me. I don't even want to be worried or concerned for anymore. Because all of those things become factors. They become links. It's like if I knock myself down, this single domino piece, I knock everyone else's tile along with mine. I don't want that. I don't want to be the cause of other people's hurting. I just don't understand why it's so fucking hard for people to let me go. I don't want to be a victim. I want to feel light. I don't know what that's like. I can't even remember the last time I felt wholehearted relief. I don't know what I'm doing anymore. I don't know what any of this means. I feel like I'm still existing, I'm still breathing because I can't let go either. And I know I'm scared of death. But not as much as I used to be. And I guess I just wish all the rational parts that continue to keep me from really doing something just broke. I'm tired. This is all so fucking weird. I'm this thing, this person with feelings and words and memories and just things that connect me to other people and let me be affected and affect other people and things and I can't handle it. I can't fucking handle it I love a lot a things. I love a lot of people. And I know that there are incredible fucking things that this weird as shit world has brought. But it's this utter permanent knowing in my head all the time now, that if I keep on pushing this, and I keep on trying and breaking and continuing, I'm doing it for me. And I can't like me. I don't know why. I wish I could fucking like me. I wish a lot of fucking things. But I also know that all of this isn't as big as my head makes it seem. And I wish the consequences that keep me from just doing it, weren't really a thing. I wish I was dead. I guess there's that difference between wishing and wanting. ",suicidal,high

Been wanting to die please read it u feel the sameHi I’ve been wanting to kill myself for a while but I decided that the least I can do is care about my body my mind enough to make it happy.yea maybe not being with someone I really want to feels like the end but surely I know it isn’t. Letting go of pain is hard but I realized I survived a whole year without killing myself and coming out of one of the hardest years of my life I can definitely say Iearned a lot. I hurt a lot but truth is that’s the only real way we can learn life lessons is through pain. It’s that pain that hurts so bad it’s something u have to pay attention to a lesson indeed. In the end we all just need food water and somebody nice to look at fun to be around and great in bed all these people and all these job opportunities that can’t be hard. I know there’s road blocks but gotta MAKE THE MOST OUT OF YOUR LIFE I’ll b 29 this year and it’s hitting me that I need to get married and have kids soon it’s a lot but for the most part I’m alive and thriving broke and all folks find one thing that makes u even a little happy and stick with it even if it’s toxic whatever u do DONT give up one day you will out grow your circumstances and move on thats life,suicidal,high

Had a really bad nightI sort of tried to kill myself last night by drinking on medication that could cause me to pass out while having a rope around my neck tied to the bathroom door. It didnt work. I didnt expect it to but I wanted to try. I dont have a gun or better method. Therapy is expensive so that's not an option. I've tried it before. I've been to too many psych wards it wouldn't help to go there. My boyfriend just reamed me out before this about all my flaws and what I did wrong the past 9 years we've been together. It made me feel so fucking horrible that I tried killing myself for the first time. I dont blame him for what he said hes right and that's what made me feel so horrible. It makes me feel like a bad person. My depression or what have you has sapped the motivation out of me. I pray to Jesus all the time out of my desperation but I cant escape feeling trapped. Ive read the bible as well. My boyfriend is the only person i have in my life. I have no friends or family I can count on. Thats why his criticisms rock me so hard.

"no one has the answers i needi wish someone had answers other than “it gets better” “you’re not alone” “it’s okay” “i care”.

i know it’s a lot to ask, but i just want to know how to make the pain stop. how to make things less terrifying, and less pressure on me constantly. i want to know how to sleep at night without the constant anxiety and horror of my trauma haunting me, knowing it’s going to keep happening. 

no one can tell me though. life is just unfiltered pain that we get handed and we’re expected to just mold ourselves around this black hole that will constantly exist within us. walk around like it isn’t ripping us to shreds inside constantly. maybe someone does care, maybe it does get better. but why do i have to feel so much fucking pain to appreciate happiness? why do i always expect things to fall apart once i feel okay? why is my existence ruled by how much i was hurt by those who were supposed to love me?

i don’t think it gets better. i think the world around me can shift and change in so many ways but i’m stuck inside the mind i was given and the experiences i’ve had. i can’t escape this maze, this continuous cycle. i can keep reaching my hand out to see if anyone will grab it and take me to a different dimension where nothing hurts and it all makes sense, but it’s not real. it doesn’t get better. you become more numb, you become more used to pain, ty expect more pain to be inflicted on you, and when it is you find comfort in it because it’s all you know. that’s all i see for my future. that’s what i think every night before i sleep. i can’t stop.",suicidal,high

"I'm just so miserable that it's honestly funny 😂I totally feel so much like shit right now, ngl. It all makes sense now....I've been feeling this dormant pain inside of me every day I  came to accept it, only to experience the pain becoming more severe and acute. But it's alright I can withstand it, I can take it all but do you honestly know what is it that I can't take anymore? Being a disappointment to people who I do my best for, being a good for nothing even though I put in all my effort and might into everything I do, making people grow tired of me, making people wait even when I do all the work to be on time, making sacrifices for the people I love only to be taken for granted in return, trying my best to make them happy even if I'm not happy, putting so much effort and still be unnoticed.... what I don't comprehend is why do I get to feel this way even though all I do is trying to never do wrong for anyone or anything.... let's speak reality though, all of the above was caused by me. I have brought it all upon myself. I never blamed anyone nor I do blame anyone because this is one hundred percent me, my life and what's become of it. Or it might just be my mental health speaking at this point I've got a side of me which has sever depression, anxiety, a self destructive trait, trauma and I don't even know what else do I have but yeah a damaged shitty mental health. 
Whatever it is. All I know is that I need to die. I really wish that I was able to donate my life to someone who actually deserves living rather than being wasted on something like me, but that's just wishful thinking. So yeah after all we are all dying it's the natural process of life. It's just a matter of time being sooner or later. So me taking my leave earlier isn't a bad thing afterall :)",suicidal,high

"I'm posting here again, i'm worried for my best friend.Hello everyone, I'm a 33 year old swedish man and my best friend told me last night that he's probably gonna kill himself after Infinity War and Game of Thrones is over, this obviously worries me very very much, when he said it i talked and listened to him for about 1 hour and i think our little conversation was great and i think it helped him very much. Me and him have been best friends since we were 4 years old, we've been in the same kindergarden, same elementary school, same high school, same gymnasium (Which is basically swedish version of college) and we've now both been working with eachother as carpenters since we were about 19 i think, so we are very close friends, we play video games and things like that together everyday, although he will never come out with me and my other friends because we drink alcohol since his dad was an alcoholic when he was young and i respect that very much.

I might have gotten a little off topic there but here's alot of what he told me last night.

He started by saying just saying that he might kill himself after GoT is finished since he has nothing else to look forward to, he later explained how he feels so lonely and that hes a virgin still which really brakes my heart because this guy would make an excellent partner for a woman, he's a very nice and caring guy, he's probably the funniest guy i've ever met,He goes to the gym everyday and he's really really strong, got really big muscles and all that, he's 6'4 aswell, he's very protective of the women in his life (Mother and Sisters) and he's very very masculine, although that might be a bad thing nowadays from what i hear but i guess women might get a primal attraction from that anyway i dont know. He's got tattoos all over his body including a very small one next to his eye which is an X, a couple on his head aswell, he got inspiration from [this](https://steamuserimages-a.akamaihd.net/ugc/853845649148230182/85A8E31667D18DF5E1C31F4E59ACAE785BD71E14/) photo of Ragnar, he has very similar tattoos, he even has a scar like him on the eye there, he resembles Ragnar very much.

He wakes up everyday, showers and brushes his teeth, makes breakfast, gets our 'company car' (not sure what its called in english) drives over to me and we drive over to whoever has hired us for carpenting help.He's lived alone and just worked for 13 years straight. I've taken vacations alot since we earn very much money from this, he's never even taken one. I've asked him about that and he said that if he doesn't work then women won't like him which is obviously not true but he doesn't listen to me and he just works anyway, and i think that hurts him very much because everyone needs to rest! I don't know how he got such a motivation to work because when we were in gymnasium me and him would always arrive late and skip school and stuff like that.

He also has a little hobby of making rap instrumental stuff, like beats or whatever its called and he's even made it to a couple mainstream songs on spotify, i won't say his name obviously in respect of his privacy.

One thing that i think he contributed to his bad mental health/suicidal thoughts is the fact that he went to prison for 4 months because he badly beat down 2 guys that tried to rob his sisters, i was there with him and we were looking for his sisters because we lost them in the big crowd and when we found them they were getting robbed by 2 guys and 1 of them had a knife (which is where he got that scar on his eye i talked about) and he directly knew what was going on and he instantly just ran towards them and he tackled one of them down who he punched in the brutally punched in the face 5-6 times and the other guy had the knife and he got stabbed in the arm and that little cut in the eye he got, then he headbutted the guy and smashed his face in, screaming loud as fuck while he did it ''DONT TOUCH MY FUCKING SISTERS'' but in swedish obviously. We were maybe 24 when that happend, his sisters were a little older than him, i dont know the age all i know is that he's their little brother.

Another thing he told me is how no girl will like him because of how scary he looks, bald with a full beard with the scar and tattoos. He said that whenever he's close to a school or any area that has kids all the kids run away because he's so scary looking, he likes kids alot and it hurts him when that happens. He lives right outside a place where kids play football alot and when the ball bounces out and goes to him on his porch all the kids get scared and it hurts him alot.

He's done alot of cries for help before but i never took them seriously which makes me feel very bad, he got a tattoo on his neck not long ago which says ''Fortis in foras In medio confringetur'' (that might not be the exact translation i just took that out of google translate) it's basically latin for ''Strong on the outside Broken on the inside''

Sorry if i just randomly talked about him sometimes, it probably wasn't helpful to the situation but i've always looked up to my best friend and i like talking about him because he's like an idol for me!

TL;DR: My best friend said that he's gonna kill himself after Game of Thrones and Infinity War is over and i don't know how to help him!",suicidal,high

"i need some emotional support before i start just saying this is a rant on my ftm transitioning issues  
hi welcome to kade continues to cry himself to sleep at night because everything hates him part 238479124. why cant family just accept me. theyre family theyre meant to accept you. yknow my sister is litterally trying to make me de-transition and wont respect the pronouns or call me the right name. whats so hard about it? whats so hard to call me kade and make me happy and comfortable. she keeps going on about how ""she supports me no matter what and just wants to see me happy"" when she doesnt even call me the right name. and im too shy and awkward to say anything about it. i hate myself. why cant I just say that this makes me uncomfortable and i frequently get stressed out and break down because of this. i cant speak to my family like i should be able to, im so afraid of their judgement and lecture. they treat me like im stupid, like i dont know whats good for myself and my identity. theyre not me, they don't know who i wanna be. for family they barely know me. i dont know them either, which makes it even better. this is why i havent came out to my dad or anyone else, im too shy and i dont know how they'll react. i just want my family to accept me, help me through this. theres nothing wrong with what i want to do, yet they treat it as if its a horrific thing, something i shouldnt embrace and be proud of. sometimes i question myself, does my family actually want to see me happy? all i want to do is feel happy and comfortable but i cant. these are people i should always feel happy and comfortable with yet all i am is uncomfortable around them. other than my mum, im so mad at my sister. like ive said before, shes trying to influence me to detransition. She doesnt say it outright but shes making it obvious. She said things like ""but im so used to calling you dead name!!!! cant i just call you dead name!?!"" and then she tries to change my name, which is horrific. She also told me to hide the fact im transitioning. she said ""you shouldnt tell people that! not everyone deserves to know you like that!!!"" Thats like telling me to hide the person I am. I feel terrible about myself, like what i am is a horrendous crime. I just want acceptence, why is that so hard to ask for. thankfully, my older brother gets it. he started calling me kade with no problem. why cant the rest of my family just be like him? Its so hard to pretend to be happy and smile, im not happy. its only around you guys and my one irl friend i really feel happy. because well, you accept me. i dont care what other people say about me, just what my family says. i dont care if random strangers are transphobic towards me, but my family? that hurts. I hate it here. I forgot to add this earlier but my sister also makes me seem like im a bad guy for not telling my mum and dad about my name. My mum is very transphobic, I don't want to tell her shit. im not ready to be emotionally bashed even more. and i dont tell my dad because im scared. what if my dad doesnt accept me? i barely talk to my dad but still, i just want him to love me. I'm so scared to talk to them, to talk to anyone. i tried to consol in my sister, try and get closer with her. but it only ended up like this. its like i cant talk to the people that should be close to me. im tired of everyone thinking a joke. its legitemetly making me hurt and stressed out. all im feeling right now is dsyphoric, unaccepted and unloved. And my family keeps asking me why i dont wanna go out and spend time with them when they treat me like that. hahahhah just yesterday i broke down infront of my sister as i tried to keep a straight face as she said all the things i listed before ahahaha. i ended up crying myself to sleep. twice. today she called me dead name and used the wrong pronouns and i just wanted to break down cry right there in public. it hurts so fucking much and i cant even distract myself from it. everything that i enjoy, or did enjoy seem impossible to do well anymore. i cant draw as well as i did, i cant play games as competitively as i knew i could. I feel tired and as if theres no reason for me to get up. i really need a genuine hug right now. one that isnt forced, one that is actually there to comfort me. sorry for ranting so long i needed to say this. please help. hahahah and this is just my identity problems wait till i start writing about the other problems. i need so much help, a hug and just any support.",normal,low

"I worry about my sister every day.My sister's in a bad place. She's struggled with suicidality for a long time. I've also dealt with it, so I know a lot of what she's going through, and I see the place she's in. What worries me is that she refuses to take suicide off the table like I did. When I talk to her, I can tell she still secretly romanticizes death. She longs for the dark, the quiet, to disappear, and it worries me. Every time I don't hear from her, I think she's done something.

I want her to get help, to make a concerted effort to get better, but I can't want it for her. I worry she doesn't really want to get better, that she wants to languish until she's ""forced"" into suicide by the circumstances of her life. She wants the decision to be made for her.

Any attempts at encouraging her to seek help just overwhelms her. She crumbles because it's too hard for her, and unless we micromanage her, she misses appointments and doesn't take her medication.

"Guilt is the only thing stopping meThis is a long post, so thanks in advance if you take the time to read it.  I'm having a really hard time...I've been on a steadily increasing dose of antidepressants, but they aren't working right now.  All the psychiatrist tells me to do is wait...he says it might start working, I need to give it more time.  Even if it does start working in a few weeks, I don't know if I can make it until then.  Everything is difficult.  I can't do anything anymore, I dread seeing people because I'll have to expend energy to seem normal.  I can't even do that anymore though...people are starting to notice how bad I am. 
I've recently taken a turn for the worse, as I have never been a particularly open person, but the past two times that I've tried opening up to someone, it's ended awfully.  About a week ago, a girl initiated a relationship with me...I thought maybe this would help me get better, but after two days, she told me she decided that she""wasn't ready for a relationship yet.""  Now I feel worse...in those few days I grew way too attached to her, since it was the first great interaction with a person that I've had in awhile.  I know this is irrational but I can't deal with it...I'm constantly thinking about her now, and I want it all to end.  This is just one of the things bothering me...I can't function anymore.
I can't ""wait"" to see if the medicine works...what if it doesn't?  What if I have to wait many more months with a different medicine, and that doesn't even work. I've come very close to killing myself multiple times now, I have a plan. Literally the only reason I haven't killed myself is that I'm guilty about what it would do to my family...I know it would ruin their lives.  The scary thing is though, I'm starting to lose that feeling too.  I'm starting think that that doesn't really matter, because I'll be gone, so I won't have to worry about it.

I’ve been suicidal for years now and I’m tired of people telling me that it’s going to get better when the sad thing is that things haven’t and things don’t appear able to improve in the future. Honestly, in most of my life situations it just seems like God is a cruel little kid who builds me up for excitement only to follow it up with extreme disappointment and sadness (sometimes within the hour). It’s starting to feel really fucked up; I just want a win for once in my life.  
It dawned on me last night that the only reason for me to not go ahead and just end my life is the effect it would have on my family; which means my only purpose is to just exist in pain and not cause any to others. I don’t want to hurt my mom with my death but I really don’t think I can do this for much longer. I know this all sounds so selfish but I’m just looking for a reason to live. Has anyone else felt this way before? How did you overcome it? What have you found to give you purpose and not fall into the void?",suicidal,high
"I think my friend is committing suicide, please help me***Note that this all takes place on Discord.***  
Okay, a little backstory.

This takes on November 9, (which in fact is my birthday, so this makes the situation more unbearable than it already has to be.) My friend, who I will not say his name for privacy purposes, and we will call Aqua, is a friend of mine I met on Discord back in early 2018. Right now he is 14 years old however, and is well known for having severe levels of anxiety and when things don't go as planned, or drama happens, he gets depressed very quickly. Him being depressed has happened many times before, however, today, it has never been this bad.   
I am apart of a friend group where me and my other friends in the group know Aqua very well. It was a normal day, until then, it was around 7:27pm EST, when my other friend had received a note from my other friend. It was a note about how annoying me and other members in the friend group. She posts it in the group chat and the other people in the group chat are quite shocked and taken away when they read it. Some were raging and some were passive about it. The group chat calms down afterwards about the message.  
At 10:45pm EST, the friend from earlier starts to freak out, telling everyone in the group chat how Aqua was actually going to kill himself. Most of the people begin to freak out as well (I say most because half of the people were online), including me. We are still freaking out and my friend is telling everyone that she is crying because of how scared she was. This makes everyone panic more than they already have to. Aqua had dmed me that day, mentioning on how he couldn't attend my birthday party (and I wasn't all mad at him or anything, in fact I am quite chill when people forget stuff about me, so this doesn't raise any flags.) However, he did mention something, in this conversation I had with him in direct messages.  


\-- *note that during this conversation Aqua had changed his profile picture completely black. --*

|7:40PM) Me: i know you're upset right now but if you need to talk to me let me know(7:41PM) Aqua: Nah I'm good I don't wanna ruin your birthday|
|:-|


I am pretty sure when he means, ""I don't wanna ruin your birthday"", he was talking about the note that my friend had sent to the friend group.  


It is unknown where he is still alive or dead at the moment of writing this post. If he isn't, I wish him the best in the afterlife. If he is still alive, I am going to encourage him to keep fighting.

"What’s the point in living if my life is affected by depression?Why bother living if I can’t have the life neurotypical people have? They get enjoyment out of life whereas all I see is the negative. I’ve missed out on my high school and college experiences because of depression and my romantic life is nonexistant because no one wants to date a depressed person.

Plus there’s the law of attraction, which basically states that you attract what you think about. Because I’m prone to negative thoughts, I always attract the negative into my life which I can’t help!

"No, not now. For the last while I was fine, but a few days ago suicidal thoughts hit me like a fucking truck. It's affecting my performance at school now.

My usual ways of coping aren't working, and I wonder if it's because I've been facing a big moral dilemma on top of things. I hate that I would rather die than do something about it. It will either make me feel worse, or maybe better. Damn, I don't know.

"I have an hour-long car-commute daily....(tw planning)I have been very depressed over the last year and for the last few months it has become critical. My insurance is awful and I am very poor, but not poor enough to be on Medicaid (ironically the agency I also work for) so I am unable to find affordable help. I am feeling very hopeless and miserable. more and more over the last few weeks, I have a very strong desire to wreck my car and end my life. recently I squished a fly in my house and I pondered over it for a weirdly long amount of time, like ""Its over just like that, huh? No pain."" That thought evolved into ""Hey kind of like a car wreck."" which has now evolved into ""I have a very good opportunity to kms that could even look like a tragic accident to my family.""

I feel oddly excited and peaceful, like planning a new project. I started working on a note, I have a plan for my cat, I am trying to tie everything up financially. I feel like I'm doing something interesting and start actually feeling less depressed, then I remember what it is that I'm planning. 

I'm so miserable, I want to die. I have gained 35 lbs since 2017. I have completely stopped talking to my friends for the last year. I make less than 30k a year at the full-time job ive been at for two years. I cant get another job, I'm too stupid and emotionally unstable for the private sector. I owe over 50k for student loans on a throw-away degree. I am a caseworker with Medicaid and SNAP and I used to love my job. I love helping people. My state's new inhumane Medicaid requirements have made me loathe my job, I feel like I am doing something unethical. my memories have turned on me too, everything I used to remember fondly has some extra stank on it for some reason. its hard to explain, but somehow in the last year my memories have all warped, everything feels painful. I cant think about school, childhood, cartoons, foods, people, relationships, pets, holidays--really anything at all w/o triggering an intrusive memory. I feel like maybe ive never been happy for a day in my life. I want to die, I really just want to die. ",suicidal,high

Because I'm a failure, I failed school twice, I've been avoiding setting up an appointment with a specialist with my family doctor to see what's up with my head, constant intrusive thoughts, I don't know what it's like to have a clear head or whatever, I just spend my days getting high(which is going to stop soon due to me not having the money for it) and playing video games too depressed to fix my life, I have no motivation to do anything, except play games and smoke weed, I'm an awful brother and son, my single mom who raised me and my sister alone with her mom doesn't need the stress from the constant arguing when she has to care for my autistic 16yo sister, I just fuck everything up, I won't amount to anything, I'm a waste of space, I might just start spending my days laying on the train tracks",suicidal,high

Sometimes when my teacher asks a question every once in a while he directs it to only the kids at home and when he does this there is only silence. Tbh I’m not sure what he expected cause right now we’re talking about std’s and shit like that and I don’t think anyone would want to talk about that with their parents probably in the next room.
