"My mother is teaching me how to cook and I feel like a sith aprentice First a kind of update to last night. She didn't kill herself as she talked she would, so I think I am safe.

I asked her to teach me how to cook a fair bit ago, but she never did it. I think that last night made her think that everything was happening because I don't cook or something, so she finally started teaching me.

I expect her to be kind of mean for how bad I am with it, but I she just says things like ""good, you are doing good Pedro"". Sometimes I feel like she is trying to quote Shieve, but I don't think she even know what star Wars is.

And to top it off, I can feel the hate fueling me to do it just so I can prove her wrong.",normal,low

Why does suicide seem like the best option?I quit my job a few weeks ago after an argument from a co-worker who was angry or depressed about something else berated me while we were busy and I was training a new hire on the stations. I have been to several restaurants and none of them are hiring. I spend my days looking fruitlessly while my daughters mother reminds me of how much of a burden I am. I made myself a noise out of wire and packed my bag with it. This will probably be buried by all of the posts by those who need love more than me but I have nowhere to turn to. I'm stumped and really think that this is the end for me,suicidal,high
"It's all I think aboutDisclaimer: This isn't anywhere near as intense as some the stuff on here and I'm in no immediate danger but I didn't know where else to post.


I'm no really sure how to express myself but here I go.

Suicide is something I just can't stop thinking about. I'm not self-destructive, I've never cut, don't drink/do drugs or any of that. All I think about is finding a good length of rope and getting it over with.

Why? I'm not really sure. I wasn't abused as a child but I was never partictulary happy. I've sought solace from frying my eyes at every possible hour I could in front of a fucking PC/TV screen. I did hang out with friends but I made a fucking fool out of myself before I moved on to College and I've never felt like I've lived that down.

Social interaction nowadays is something I want and enjoy but I always come away feeling drained and needing space to myself which I know many people do I just feel so fucking pathetic for needing that.

I change as a person socially too. By myself I feel proper. When I'm out I can't help acting like a fucking fool. It's like I just completely lose control of who I really am and start trying to be ""Witty"" or ""Funny"". Every night I come home and think ""Why the fuck did I say/do that?"" and feel further ashamed of myself but when I'm out of my room and with other people I can't help it. Before anyone suggests that it might be an improvement, let me tell you that I act like a fucking minion around people. It's fucking disgusting. I just cannot be myself around anyone, even on a one-to-one basis.

I'm not even sure if I could go through with it because I'm just so monumentally fucking lazy. Even this has taken me well over 2 hours to write. I have no pick-me-ups, no motivational strategies. Exercises hasn't given me any energy and browsing /r/getmotivated and /r/fitness has only made me feel worse. I have work due in for tomorrow but I haven't lifted a finger to do it and the more I think about it, the more angry I get but I still cannot do anything. I just cannot work.

I can't even play drums anymore because there's just so many better players than me. I can't focus on what I'm doing because I just keep thinking about how terrible I sound compared to them. I know I'm gonna get told ""Use it a strategy"" but I fucking try that and it gets me nowhere, I cannot use their success to fuel me. It doesn't work.

If I did commit suicide, I know it'd be massively unfair. The ""friends"" I've come to make in my time will not see it coming and they'll ask why and blame themselves or some stupid shit like that so I know that if I were to go about doing it that it'd be rather a dick move. I recently saw my Grandfather who I haven't seen in about 4 years and the couple of hours I spent with him actually took my mind of it all. He's getting really old now and told me to stay in touch which I plan to do but the day after I was back t thinking the same way so I resolved that if I decided that I would eventually end it, I'd make sure to outlive him because that would be beyond unfair to him.

I probably have other stuff to say but that's all I can think of for the time being. I don't know what I wanted to achieve by posting here (I'm well aware some people have it far worse than I)but I feel better now that I have. 

Thanks for reading this far, I'm open to PMs as well. Please keep up all the good work that this Sub-Reddit does and thanks again for taking the time out to hear me whine.",suicidal,high
"I don't know, a long winded lament of sortsThis is my third post on here.  First was my actual suicide attempt three months ago and getting hung up on by the hotline people. Second was just a struggling to find a reason rant.  I don't know if this helps my resolve or what. It's not attention.  I have the insurance and ability to get the attention with my care team if that's what I needed...

I think I just want permission.  I keep telling everyone I'm so tired and just once I wish one of them would tell me it's okay, to go rest,  I don't have to keep hurting. 

I have a very long history with all sorts of abuse. I've been in therapy for three years straight (on and off for 9 years before that) and have done the SSRI throw a dart at a board and see what works and came up broke.  I'm an active cutter. It's been the only appropriate way other than eating disorder shit that I've ever been allowed to have emotions with my family.  I told my mom about being suicidal and she got angry with me because my older siblings died from genetic disease and ""they would have wanted to be here now and you want to take that gift that was stolen from them and ruin it. "" 

I have nothing left.  I left my long term partner after being disillusioned by someone else and now have neither person in my life. I have plenty of superficial friends but none that at the end of this month when I officially lose the apartment,  that I can go to.  I will have a storage unit and no home and too much debt on me to even begin to think about renting anything more than that storage unit. 

I can't go home to my parents without being overwhelmed by the mental abuse my mom puts on me (that she will deny for her whole life and well past her last breath)  and my dad has made me very uncomfortable with the way he's acting and started to touch me and speak with me. 

I have lost everything that kept me going now.  I was going to kill myself after I knew my ex was safely in a new home. I was going to drink my favourite bottle of wine and curl up with the overly large stuff dog on the floor of the storage but the storage guy is so nice.  I don't want to do that to him. I started thinking about hiking to the point at blue hills I love and laying down under the stars and doing it but I don't want to traumatize any unsuspecting hikers and make it hard for my body to be taken out. 

I'm still debating the storage unit with a sign on my door to not go in.  I'm at the point where I've written letters to my mom and dad and one other person that deserves the long ass letter I wrote her. I just feel so much pain. I want it to be over today. I keep hoping everyday I wake up (if I actually sleep that night) I would have rethought and been waffling about actually killing myself but I've been steadfast. I'm going to but waiting is just been this agonizing feeling. My heart hurts like a crushing pain and I feel like I can't breath as electric fire courses through me.  I'm crying almost everyday now. I never asked to be alive. Even when I was little (before kindergarten but moreso at six) I used to tell my parents I don't know how to be alive and I don't know what the point of it all was and didn't want to do it.  They made me go to church in response.  I've given up. I feel intense anger for being forced through guilt to maintain my life of misery. 

I'm tired of therapy and meds and the hospitals.  It's not working.  I panic at the thought of being alive another year let alone a good 30 more if I continue on like my parents want.  Just let me go and be at peace. Living in the 7th ring of hell won't be so bad if Christianity is to be believed. I can handle physical pain, I just can't handle the emotional turmoil I've lived for 22 of my 27 years of life.  I'm too tired.  Once I know everyone is safe and it's only going to emotionally hit them,  I'm going to finally get the rest I need. Thank you for sticking it out to this point. For reading this lament. I don't have anything inspiring to say nor a profound point.  Posting here just gives me more peace in my decision.",suicidal,high

"This tiktok scared me half to death until I discovered what it actually was So I was born in Saudi Arabia to Lebanese parents and I've lived here my whole life. And growing up in this country I'm just like any other teen but people on reddit act like I live in the sand. They say stuff about how dangerous and backwards it is and how there are public executions everywhere.
Obviously I would discredit it because to me it's a normal country and I've never seen a dead body in my life. A few minutes ago this video came into my recommendation page [here](https://vm.tiktok.com/ZSJLHy2jq/) I was so confused because the guys were dressed like old english executioners and there was a guy kneeling down. What I didn't get was why his head wasn't covered so I went to the comments. Everyone was acting normal and I didn't see anything about the guy about to be 'killed'. 
Then I found this comment:
Drip عامل النظافة 🥶🥵
Which means the janitor (I think? I don't know the actual word for it) has drip.
These guys weren't going to kill anyone they were just protected from the dust which is normal here. It's just I've never seen that specific mask before and the broom looked like a sword",normal,low

"I'm getting moved from my class for the stupidest thing ever In my country we have a system of form classes, where a group of 30-ish people in your year group are together. You do classes like English, maths, and science together in the junior years, and then only see each other for 15 minutes a day for this thing called form time. You stay with your form class for all five years of college (high school). I really love my form class and most of them really like me, with a few exceptions. During PE one time we were playing a game called McKenzie Ball, which is essentially ultimate/all-in tag but with balls. I had teamed up with a few fellow classmates and our goal was to get all the really athletic people and keep the people that got them up. Essentially we have like 4 athletic kids in our class. Now this one girl which I've had some issues with in the past is also an athletic kid, so when we did our tactic on her she understandably got a bit mad. But all the rest of the people took it like good sports. But she snitched because a few weeks after I'm told by my Dean that I'm getting moved classes over such a bullshit issue, I mean it's just a game. A few classmates wrote emails to the teacher and there is a petition for me going on with around 92 signs which most of my class has signed. Apparently my school does things ""fairly"" here, but if they really do they should listen to our voices and correct this injustice.",normal,low

"It's hard for me.I don't know what to do.

For the past 10 years of my life I have been going through a mental and emotional struggle with the events that have been happening in my life. This might be long so I apologize, but I really need to get everything off my chest otherwise I fear that I will end up doing the worse possible deed and take my life.

It all started when my parents got divorced when I was 12 years old. My father was a nice man when he was sober, but once he was drunk it was nothing but violence and chaos. He was very abusive especially towards my mother. So bad to the point that he ended up putting her life, and mine in constant danger when he was in his drunken states. This is what lead to the divorce.

Keep in mind I was only in the 7th grade when my parents got a divorce so it was hard for me. Especially when I was the one who was being blamed by the man who I looked up to as my hero (when he didn't drink) for the divorce. Once it was finalized I found myself seeing my father less and less over the years. He did stop drinking, which was good because when hes sober he was a nice guy. This caused me to fall into a deep depression. The man who I knew since I was a baby slowly began to want nothing to do with me and it hurt.

I acted out in school because of this. I would get into countless fights. I became hot headed and developed one of the worse tempers some people have ever seen. I hated the world and I hated who I was, at this stage in my life I genuinely believed the divorce was my fault. Eventually my mother remarried and while it was the best thing for her, it made my depression worse. To me it felt like she replaced my father and tried to bring another one into my life and I hated that. This caused me to lash out even more in my adolescence. 

Fast forward to the summer before I attended my first year of High School. I met a girl who was the polar opposite of me. She was calm and collected, she was quiet and through things through. She slowly began to teach my that my anger wasn't the answer, while this was true, it still didn't help the thought I had dwelling in the back of my head. Now through all of this up to this point in my life I had attended counseling and therapy because I would self harm and had attempted suicide before. 

So while I dated this girl (I don't want to give her real name away, so I will call her X) I slowly began to fall in love with her. We dated and were on and off, however we would always get back together days later. We dated from the time I was 14 to the time I was 18. Now fast forward to when I was 18 before I moved away for college. We had our final break up. The reason for the break up tore my apart inside, for 3 of the 4 years we dated she had been cheating on me. I only found out because she tried to cheat on me with my best friend at the time. Him being an amazing friend told me right away. This sent me spiraling back into my bad habits again, but now that I was an adult, fighting was out of the question. So self harming was at the time my only solution.

First my parents divorce, then my father slowly started fading out of my life, but was still somewhat there due to me putting in the effort to keep him in it, and now the girl I was in love with betrayed me. I fell even deeper into my depression. I would cut away at my arms, punch walls until I broke my knuckles, fingers, or hands. this went on for about half a year, then it was time for me to move to college.

My parents (Mother and Step Father) moved me down to my current residence. Now I didn't go to college right away, instead I had gotten a job and worked for a few months, hoping that if I was busy with work I would not want to harm myself. I was wrong, so then I took on school as well and while it did help keep me busy and my mind off the thought of hurting myself it did make my mental state worse. I was struggling to juggle a job and school, so I had to drop school and continued to work. This continued until I went back again at the age of 21.

Now that I am 22 I have been working and doing school. I have done nothing but avoid people. I hide my pain and my negative mind behind a false sense of optimism. I purposely act like I have energy and I be loud to hide these issue. While this might fool people it wasn't fooling me. Then before the new year started I found out news I never wanted to hear. My mother is ill and she has heart and body problems. The news she told me about her health was pushed aside because I couldn't accept the fact of losing my mom. So I pretended it was just a dream.

Then I lost my insurance that pays for my medication for my Muscular Dystrophy and Tourettes. While I do not need the Tourettes  medication because I smoke CBD and Marijuana, I need the MD medication. Thankfully I have some stock piled from throughout the years, but it can't last forever. Everything happening in this short period put me in a state of just, silence. I had nothing to say. I went a week or so without speaking to anyone. Now at this time there is a girl that I have liked for about 6 months that I work with (We will call her Y), but I haven't said anything about me liking her at this point. She was the first to notice something changed. So she spent that week trying to get me to talk about my feelings.

I keep people shut out for the sole purpose that I don't want to be hurt and abandoned again. That being said, I broke down in front of Y. I let her in and explained my situation to her and she was there to be a friend that I needed. Fast Forward to last month, February. I had tried to take my life again. One of my friends from work told Y that I was acting strange, and since I only open up to her they had her call me. I was in the process of getting everything together to do it. I had finished typing up my will and I was ready. I couldn't take it anymore.

That's when Y knocked on my door and took me out for a car ride. I broke down and told her how I felt and i explained to her why I was doing it. I was alone. Up to this point my father and I still kept in contact, then he disowned me completely. He refuses to speak to me and now only puts his attention towards his new wife and her children. Y tried to comfort me and that night after she dropped me off after staying up until 4 am to make sure I was okay I confessed how I felt to her. Now I already knew she didn't like me how I liked her and I was fine with that, at the time I didn't need a girlfriend, I just needed a friend. While my emotions stay the same, my mind is constantly battling with itself. 

I'm not happy. I feel alone. It isn't normal to think about suicide constantly on a daily basis. The only reason I haven't done it yet is because.. well I don't know. That's why I am here. In hopes that talking about it will change my mind for at least one more day. Tonight I had made arrangements for all my friends, including Y, to all be together and hang out, watch movies, play some video games. I planned on taking my life when I got home. Now I don't know. I'm not afraid of dying, the thought of what happens after doesn't scare me.

I don't know.. I just feel like Y is only putting up with me because I tried taking my life that night. I feel like she just doesn't want the thought of someone she knows dying. I feel like people don't actually like me and they are just being nice because they don't want to be rude. All of my emotions are bottling up and I don't know what to do.

I just want to cry, I want to cry until I have nothing left. My life feels like it is in shambles. I don't want to lose my mom. I don't want to lose my dad. I don't want to lose Y. 

I don't know what to do.",suicidal,high

After everyone left the house except for my family members and my cousins to which they are staying for the whole night, I quickly ask myself ""hey its my birthday I should masturbating to make it the best bday ever"" I quickly got into my room with the lube that I bought and started doing my thing and then...all of my family members opened the door which I forgot to lock and screamed ""HAPPY BIRTHDA-"" I said ""ITS NOT WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE"" and some of them laugh and my dad said ""its OK, let us know when you're done"" I didnt finished it obviously I was ASHAMED I quickly went downstairs and they shouted ""HAPPY BIRTHDAY!""

"Friend is going to end up in bad situationLooking for thoughts and information.  Girl is using him to advance her life.  He knows the rest of the friends opinions on his relationship, but he has been a lonely guy and is blinded.  He has stated, to her and others, that if she hurts him he will kill himself.  I am concerned he may hurt others as well.

The reason it comes to this point is that they just got engaged, I give this situation another year or two. My thought at this point is to just say 'congrats, wish you all the best' but then comment on what he has previously said.  Then provide him with numbers of councilors to call before he does anything which cant be undone.

"life is over at 18long story my life is over before it started. i used to be excited to wake up everyday now i cant stand it.

&amp;#x200B;

first of all im illiterate i barely finished 10th grade i was taken out by my parents for dumb reasons (another reason im suicidal) ive  had dyslexia since the 1st grade so idk why it was a great idea to take me out of school. i already have learning issues so lets make it harder for me please. im an 18 year old girl who cant get along with her family has no friends to run to when i cant stay home, im losing faith in God/humanity. i am christian but why does god hate me so much to make my life so miserable ?!?!? why do i try hard and still have this life !?!? no i dont have my GED or diploma i cant take it because 1 i have practiced online and i dont know 80% of the stuff bc again i didnt go to school and bc of my learning disability it makes it 5x as hard to study (even tho i still try, im not giving up). 2 my parents wont give me money to take it. 3 my mom said she wouldnt give me the money to take it because she has no faith in me. 4. ive been waiting 2 years to to get into a home schooling or a ged program they will not enroll me. why dont i get a job and pay for it ??. my parents wont give me my documents. why dont i report them because im an adult and they legally cant hold my documents (birth certificate, ID, SSN) because i dont wanna be homeless and im an adult so they could legally kick me out. 

&amp;#x200B;

 i wanna die bc whats the point of living !??!?! most kids at 18 have finished high school have a job arent fucking stupid like me are actually in college have friends social lives and are ready to move out while im still be treating like a kid getting my phone taken away have no money cant get a job cant get a license cant get an education because my parents wont let me. imagine wanting an education and your parent havenent put you in school in 4 years !?!?! and you couldnt do a thing about it bc you were underaged and if you told anyone like CPS they would kick you out. and how would i get a job any way if if fucking too illiterate to write a paragraph and you have social anxiety so bad you cant speak.

&amp;#x200B;

my mom hates me she told me that. she said im not her daughter im just a bitch she gave birth to. shes verbally, mentally, and physically abusive. a fucking drunk, she starts arguments and fights and when i pushed her off of me once my whole family acted like i was the problem. yelling at me claiming i hit her. i wish i fucking could punch her in the face !!! my dad doesn't live with me. he lives in a man camp for his job so i cant live with him.  

&amp;#x200B;

i used to have one friend who was in the same situation as me we were planning on leaving our toxic parents and moving out together. but she moved out bc she had a boyfriend so now she lives with him  and his nice family. i dont talk to her anymore because thats how life goes but lucky her to have a loving support system i have no boyfriend im asexual because i was raped as a child and now cant form intimate relationships and they make me uncomfortable. wow i love childhood trauma making me suicidal today. i told my parents when it happened when i was young seems like they dont care now bc they still bring him up to this day because he lives down the street from our home ( he was a family) i hate them for that. 

&amp;#x200B;

i have no one because i cut everyone off by isolating myself. most of my friends were in school so when i left i became depressed and stopped talking to people. the moved on with life to have great lives. getting into college, moving out, finding better less boring people to hang with. i see them on social media living it up while im on the verge of suicide everyday. even the people that bullied me in school are living great. parties every weekend happy lives. i wasn't shy when i was in school. i was the type of person to become the shy kids friend. if i saw someone sitting alone i would go sit with them. i was nice to everyone. I was bubbly always making jokes hyper ect. i had big group of friends. so seeing myself depressed and lonely and dull with no emotion makes me feel even more pathetic. i met with an old friend i couple weeks ago and he said i was so different now and ""BORING"" .i thought to me self yeah thats what depression does to you. i havent spoke to him sense bc he hasnt hit me back. guess i really was boring fuck. i try talking to my old friends. we didnt leave off on beef but they just dont reply or they treat me like im someone under them. they probably know i didnt graduate. or they have better lives than me and are busy so thats why im beneath them. i see people from school still friends and close hanging out and loyal but i go through a tuff time in my life and NO ONE COULD STAY BY MY SIDE. im not exaggerating i have literally no one but myself NO FRIENDS NO FAMILY AT 18 YEARS OLD NO ONE BY MYY SIDE SAYING ""YOU CAN DO THIS"" JUST ME AND IM SICK OF ME.

&amp;#x200B;

IM FUCKING DONE WITH LIFE I WANT THIS TO BE OVER. i have only put out good and love into the world when my friends were depressed i cried for them and talked them out of sadness and hurt. i was there for people. i never was a bully. i never hurt people. NOW IM SUFFERING I NEED SUPPORT MORE THEN I EVER HAVE IN MY LIFE AND I GET LEFT ON DELIVERED LEFT ON READ, ""SORRY IM TOO BUSY, SORRY I HAVE PLANS""............................................LIFE ISNT HOW IT WORKS ON THE MOVIES.

"I thinking of ending itI hate my life, and I’m only 15. I don’t know if I’ll make it to 16. I go to therapy and I’ve been struggling with suicidal thoughts. But they were just thoughts. Then I told my therapist that I had these thoughts and she sent me to another therapist. After one appointment she said she wanted me to go back but that I would have to schedule it. But I didn’t schedule that second visit. Now those thoughts became me wanting to do it. I don’t trust anyone I talk to and I refuse to open up about this to anyone I meet. Because I don’t trust them, they could tell someone else. A couple years ago I hurt myself and asked to go to the hospital where I was told I was making it all up. My mom got mad at me about it, because it was a hefty bill. I don’t trust her with anything anymore. I don’t trust my dad or my sisters. I just want to end it. My grandma had a stroke and is in the hospital. I hate school because I have no one to make me do it. So I keep procrastinating it. I’m battling anxiety every day of my life, I have ADD but my mom doesn’t want to let me take my medication because “I don’t need it” I guess the only reason I’ve not ended it is because I’m scared. I don’t feel like I have enough reasons to be suicidal. Everyday I struggle with all these things but there’s a voice that’s telling me that I’m faking it all. It’s all because I want attention.

"I got the closest I’ve ever been to killing myself last night: need adviceSorry in advance, as I’m new to Reddit and really don’t know what I’m doing. I’ve been extremely depressed and somewhat suicidal for about the last 2 months. I’ve pretty much always struggled with depressed but I haven’t gotten this low in years. Yesterday evening once I had time to myself I sunk back into a dark place I had been in the day before as well. Except yesterday, it got much darker. I began wandering around my campus aimlessly because I didn’t want to be at home. I started to burn myself. I’ve never self harmed before 2 days ago. I wandered for hours just sitting place to place either crying or feeling absolutely nothing. the things that I remind myself of that usually make me not want to die weren’t working. I started thinking of ways I could kill myself easily in that moment, which was big because I usually don’t plan or get too emotional to plan. I didn’t tell anyone what was going on until I snapped into a moment of clarity and texted my best friend that I really needed help. It’s the following morning and he still hasn’t opened the messages, but I could see where he was on Snapchat and at one point he was at a bar so I’m sure he was drunk and avoiding me which really hurt. I almost fell asleep in a field just because I didn’t want to go back. I ended up smoking a lot of weed and feeling better, but that was a just a temporary solution. I know this post is really long I just don’t know what to do and I feel like I’m running out of options. Any comment would help. Thank you.

Note: I’m not sure if this is related to the events now, but I tried acid for the first time on Saturday and had a really good trip except that the friend I did it with got depressed on the come down and left only saying “I need to be alone” which made me kinda spiral and get really anxious and depressed. Today makes 3 days since the trip and I’m not sure if my mood now and the trip are related and to what degree. thought I’d add this at the end just in case.",suicidal,high

My current life and history is so unreal people refuse to believe our family about it. Its almost comical now. I am normally okay dealing with family drama. But one thing that happened I have never put much thought into is the fact of my grandfather's suicide in 2001. I was only 1 and a half at the time. He committed suicide by stepping in front of a train. My dad was and is completely destroyed by it, and what ensued, but that's off topic.

Growing up. No one ever talked about him, unless it was someone showing me something that used to be his. I didn't know what his face looked like till the last few months. My gran is only just starting to talk about him now. I want to ask questions about him, because I never knew him, but I know how much he meant to my dad. I haven't seen my dad in nearly 2 years.

"I think my mom has a boyfriend This should be okay right? My parents have been divorced for about 2 years now, and my mom has had at least one BF since then that I know about. (I only found out about it because I saw a good night text on her phone once with heart emoji). I asked her about it and she said she was dating him.

My mom is very open and kind, so it shouldn't really bother me, right?? Anyways, today she went to a big lake in North Cali on a day trip, and I was in another city with my best friend. When I came back, I saw her car was still here, but she wasn't, so I was wondering how she got there. When she got back, I asked how it went and who she went with. She said it was good and that she went with a friend. Normally she would tell me which friend, but she didn't specify. I had a suspicion from that (also because she was dressed up) so I didn't press it. Also, a couple nights ago I heard her talking to a guy on the phone once I got out of the shower. She hung up shortly after I got out. I asked who it was and she said it was just a friend.

I don't know what to do. It's not like I can't bring it up because she is a good mom and likes to help me through things. I guess I just don't know if I want to. I shouldn't really care because 50% of marriages do end in divorce, so I'm obviously not a special case. I just feel sad about it...",normal,low

"Need advice/thoughts on my situationHi, I’m 19 years old. Thank you if you read this. Couple weeks ago I had a turning point in my life. I crashed. I lost it all, I lost my car of course, I lost my mom, I lost my job, the love of my life, my life, my will to keep going. Little summary about me; I’ve always worked very hard for things I’ve wanted. I almost went pro in soccer back in 2016. I got invited to run for the US in Australia last year, I got invited to the Olympic Trials in May this year. You can tell I could do anything if my mindset is good. I never thought this turning point in my life would come, I wasn’t ready. It’s been like 8 weeks, I haven’t done much since. I tried to take my life over 4 times, it’s very painful seeing all your blessings crumble all at once after working so hard for them. My only job recently was making music. I was making money off it. It was going well, saw a light for me again and then my laptop got stolen. Another set back that made me think about destroying myself. I literally don’t have anything anymore. I live with my step dad but me and him don’t get along well. I’m not really wanted here. I want to go out and make shit happen for myself. I have so much potential but it’s almost if I can’t by being here in this house. It’s very depressing. If I could’ve kept making music I would’ve been out in my own place by next year but it’s all gone now. Any thoughts are welcome, I really want to hear opinions",suicidal,high

I find comfort in solitude, yet it's also when I'm the saddest. I just want a break or for something to show me to keep going it'll pay off real soon. I just want to be alone, to be forgotten so I can disappear without hurting anyone's feelings. I just want to cry. I just want a hug telling me I'll be ok.

"I have no reason to live anymore.Sorry ,for making you guys have to read all of this shit, you are  not obligated to read this wall of text, even with all these grammar errors (because english is not my first language), but i just had to trow it all out.

It's not the first time i felt worthless, people always said to me things like; * ""this is just a phase, it get's better with, just forget it."" *well, i've probably waited for pretty a long darn time for this is so called * ""better"" *, as a matter of fact i can't just keep up the way i'm right now, not just like that.

My family  treats me like a child, as if i had no capabilities of walking down the street alone, even tough i'm an adult myself right now, i have to endure verbal abuse from my step-mother almost every single fucking day, she would keep calling me"" idiot, useless, dumb, retared"" etc etc,  even when i try to defend myself (trough words, obvious, i hate violence, i'm a very emotional man,  i don't  know if this is goot at all.) she once humilhated me in front of a crowd, you can imagine how bad this felt.  She would verbally assault me and treaten me to kick me out of home (this happend three times already, but i was able to convice her to go back.) My father will just sit and watch the whole thing, as a matter fact, he was barely present in my life at all, i only live with them because school is near, and the city i live is big.


I could always try move to one of my grandparents home, but they live a thousand miles form where i'm currently,  and they can't even take care of themselfs anymore,  so this is not an option.

My self esteem is also going down the hill, i don't have a reason to live at all like i said, torugh my whole life i always had to endure people saying to me that i should become a doctor or a laywer in order to be someone in my life over and over again, like if i would be nothing if i didn't and if were nothing right now. I wanted to become an artist (because the girl i like revealed this to me.) whenever i would draw or paint, i would forget most of my problems, then i fell in love with art, but my consant depression is almost making me lose intersted in art too.

My body isn't atractive at all. I only weight 50kg and acne is a common enemy. 

Even worse is that i have earing and sleep issues,  i can't sleep because my breathing sometimes get really bad(doctors would say frequent sinusitis, but i was never able to figure it out.) i'm totally deaf of one of my ears and i feel that the other is slowling loosing hearing ( i have this because of a malformation) this sucks a lot, i would always hear people saying ""i wish i was deaf so i couldn't hear that bullshit."" and when i had the chance i would reply: you wouldn't want that, believe me.

I was also diagnosed with spectrum autism, so yeah, this make me shy as fuck, and i'm not a genius at all.

I feel like a worthless piece of shit, i can't do any good shit, my grades are getting worse and worse and my urge for study just went down the hill, i just don't have reasons to study anymore. The worst is that i was always bad in math, now i'm basically a cavemen on this area, i needed to learn math in order to pass in a University entrance exam, but i don't care anymore.

Shit just got worse for me when my best friend just suddenly stopped speaking t ome (don't ask me why, when  i tried to find about why, she told me to stop asking.)  and with her, i also lost the little conversation i had with the girl i liked, she also suddenly stoped talking to me, speaking with her was one of the things that made me keep moving on and she was the one that made me realize art was my thing, now i lost almost any friendship i had in the entire school, and the chance of seeing the eye so f the most beatiful girl i has ever seen as well.

 If i at least confessed something to her some months ago, i believe i could still have a chance, but i'm better at winning the lottery right now.

The only friends i have now are three guys: verlafixin, fluoxetine and ritalin (the last one know to be a cousin of cocaine, but i don't if this is true.) They help me make feel like a zombie and help me stay awake when i need while helping me to sleep and forcing short bursts of hapiness, but yeah, i only use these to sleep like a rock, so i can't remember my problems in my bed.

Like i said, i don't even care about living anymore, if it wasn't for destiny of some shit i probably wouldn't be a live by now, the last time two dudes tried to rob me i said: ""i won't leat you steal my stuff, but if you want it, you can kill me, because i really don't care."" I probably didn't die because the robbers didn't believe on what they were hearing, so they just left me. I don't know if this should be call luck or unluck, but whatever.

I at least wished i could move to another country, very very far from here, start a new and fresh life. But if this was that easy.... 

So now i'm pretty dead by inside and i don't care for what happens to me anymore, i tried to overdose myself manytimes, but i'm way to coward for that, so i just let my life in the hand of whatever god exists out there.from here, start a new and fresh life.

"I'm going to kill myself by the end of this monthI'm a 19 f. I've contemplating the idea of killing myself before whenever i was depressed on my pre-teen years, anyway i never did it 'cause deep inside me i knew it was my depression doing the thinking, not my brain. Now, years later, is the first time im actually thinking about it without being depressed. I've, for the first time, analyzed everything with a critical mind. Life just makes no fucking sense. The way the world works, is the most stupid system that anyone could come up with, im here now all down and fucking desperate because i can't get a job. Im all suffocated by the senseless concept that money is. I've been trying to get a job since i finished school 3 years ago but here none hires you if you have no experience, you are ugly or they just don't fucking know you. People here only hire friends of friends. I can't push myself here 'cause. Here's the thing. I can't talk. This has been my biggest problem my whole miserable life since i remember. I don't know how to talk to people . I can't express myself, i can't even go to the grocery store alone to buy shit. i've had social anxiety in the past, i've been homeschooled the last 2 years of high school. All my problems are originated by my lacking social skills. I've always blamed this on my family for rising me like shit making me grow up to be the selfish incapable of talking piece of shit that i'm now. I always hated everyone for not liking me. I only have one friend, and she and my two siblings are the only people i talk to. I mean don't even ""talk"" to them, i just answer whatever shit they tell me. BUT FINALLY i realized that i have none but myself to blame for this shitty life im living. I fucking hate myself. I can't believe I lived so long without realising it.I fucking hate myself for isolate me and push everyone away from me. I could have had so many friends but i pushed them away, i never did anything nice for anyone. I can't fucking think on one stupid small good thing i ever did for anyone. I never hugged anyone honestly. I've never been to a party. I've never told anyone that i liked them, I was never told neither. I've never kissed anyone. There are so many things i never did 'cause i decided that the rest of the world wasn't worth it. And now i see this things i always blamed on my upbringing and oh jesus im the only one to blame, im so miserable. i hate myself so much for it. The worst part is that now i want to change that but i can't cause i was never given the tools to do so. I was always alone. I don't know how to reach out for anyone. I honestly don't know what im supposed to do. My sister was the only pilar in my life but yesterday she decided to stop helping me 'cause i never did anything with the help she gave me. She is fucking right, i hate seeing her waste her life trying to help a lost cause like me. I live with my brother and he tries to talk to me but all i do is scream at him and tell him to leave me alone. I have problems, i'd went to the therapist before, i've had like four different doctors over the past years, but they never helped me 'cause i never told them anything, they only asked me stuff and i answered them or i even let my mother answer the questions for me. Now i have no money to go to a shrink. I have no job, my brother doens't have a job and i just can't do anything to get one. I have no parents nor family besides my siblings. My sister who was the only support i had, decided to stop helping me and now Im here all alone in the dark in my room wondering how a piece of living shit like myself could get to the end of the month. Im fucking desperate. I have no tools to face what is comming. I don't even want to die. There are so many things i want to do but i cant because of how i am. I don't want to die, i just don't want to be myself anymore I fucking hate the person i've become. i can't ""un-become"" me. i don't know how, i don't even think that that's possible. i hate living in my skin.

I just wanted someone to know this. How i am feeling. To hear my feelings before i fade. I won't send or tell this to any of the 3 people i have left. I know they can't help me. The only person that can help me right now is me. but im not able to. i gave myself an ultimatum of 10 days left to figure it out. if i don't find a solution on this lapse i'm going to kill myself.

"I don't wanna fight anymoreI first starting thinking about killing myself in first grade. I first tried to kill myself when I was 13, 12 years ago. I made a promise to my friend back then that I would wait 10 years because I thought all my problems were related to living at home with my crazy family and being in high school and being bullied at school and home. 

Fast forward and I still feel like shit every day. I have no hope of pursuing any of my dreams. I am glad not to be in high school anymore but I still get bullied or treated like crap a lot. I know a lot of it is probably my fault because I suck at everything and I annoy everyone. I have to take medicine for ADHD to function. Pill for attention, pill for memory, pill for keeping the worker bee productive and happy enough to not revolt. I wouldn't need them if the world had any kind of acceptance of people's different strengths and talents. But I've basically come to the conclusion that I just don't fit in this society and I'm very close to being done even trying anymore. 

I live in Texas and there have been several deaths recently attributed to idiots driving on flooded roads. It's been scary how attractive the idea would be for me to go and...see what happens. One of my main reasons for not killing myself is that my mother is depressed and if she knew I killed myself she would probably do it too. And that's not fair to my siblings, they still need her (They're in high school.) I was proud at myself for making it past my 20th birthday because my cousin died when he was 20 and it was really hard on me even though it was an accident. I don't want to do that to them. But it would be better if it was an accident. 

Everyone I tell about my feelings basically says suck it up. I told my roommate I wanted to kill myself because all that life seems to be is struggling through useless bureaucratic corporate nonsense that is meaningless to anyone experiencing any manner of suffering. I'll never have any opportunity to achieve any kind of contribution to the planet in terms of self-actualization because I'm so burned out from my job. I'll never get to travel or see the world because I'll always be spending whatever money I have catching up on the evermounting debt and the 2 weeks a year I get off are usually eaten up by illness, family obligations, and recovering from overwork. He told me ""Well that's what life *IS*..."" and didn't understand why I was upset. Work work work and then you die. No thanks!  

I started working in health care when I was 18 because I convinced myself that even if I couldn't do anything to help the world be a better place with things that I liked doing, I could at least help someone else. 6 years later I am officially burned out and past recompense. I have anxiety attacks in the storage room at work. The endless suffering around me simultaneously burns with how awful it can be and how little I can do to stop any of it, and also with guilt how much I've stopped caring about it because it just never. fucking. ends.

Why keep living if it's just going to end up this way? There isn't a way out. No matter what you do you'll end up in pain because life is basically suffering. Why do people do this? 

I have always figured it wouldn't matter as much/be as much of a formative experience for my siblings if I died when they were older, so I've held on for their sake. One of them graduates from high school this weekend, the other is going to be a junior. 2 more years of this looks like fucking hell. I keep thinking it won't be that bad. We don't have much of a relationship anyway. 

If I died it wouldn't impact anyone but my SO and they told me they can't deal with my depression anymore. I've told them I want to kill myself. I told my coworker. I told my roommate. I told my friends. I told my mom. And nobody had anything to offer as a reason why NOT except for how it would affect them personally, i.e. ""I would be sad if you weren't here."" Why? ""Because"" and then they can't elaborate. I don't think most of them took me seriously except my SO and they were just basically like ""don't do this to me right now.""  Ok, I'll be sure and schedule my next psychological crisis for when you don't have a big meeting at work. My priorities are just out of order or something. 

I don't offer anything to this planet and I'm shut off from basically anything it has to offer me due to lack of resources. I just don't think reading another shitty book or watching the entire catalog of Netflix or visiting the same park is a reason to continue being miserable 50 hours a week for the next 40 years. 


God, the river is raging outside, and I want so badly to lose myself in it. I won't do it because I don't want to throw a shadow on the graduation. But faking happiness has worn me so far down, I don't know how I'll make it through the whole rigmarole, let alone the next 2 years. ",suicidal,high

"Everyone I know loves me. Why am I the only one who hates me?The pressure of life has come to be more than I can handle. I am a good person. I help out friends, co-workers, family and strangers any time im needed yet I feel in the background all the time. I feel like my feelings &amp; my thoughts doesn't matter. I go unnoticed so much that I think I could end my life without anyone caring. 

My job has me working in a hard, stressful environment. My bosses treat me as if I'm disposable although I break my back everyday. My skillset is doomed to keep me in near poverty for as long as I live. I dont see a bright future ahead of me.

The only reason I haven't been found hanging in a closet somewhere by now is because of my son. He's the best thing in my life by far but I feel like someone else could be a better father to him than I am. I would only be a vague memory if I died today. He would learn to write and read from his step dad, I would only be known as the guy who couldn't take being a dad anymore...

I'm rambling. The point is that I dont want to live with these thoughts anymore. They've been in my head in some form or fashion for 25 years &amp; it only gets worse each wave of depression. I dont **want** to die but I want these thoughts out of my head so I can function without suicidal thoughts. I always would say I'm delaying the inevitable whenever I put off suicide. I dont want that to be my legacy.",suicidal,high
"Please talk me out of these thoughtsI used to be a model, traveling to Europe and New York and LA all the time.

I used to think getting out of the industry would make it better.

So I did. Then I thought money could make it better. Today I earn well over six figures working for myself.

Then a relationship. I’m depressed in my relationship. I’m depressed outside of it. The antidepressants are only doing so much.

My parents have a lot of guilt over letting me get assaulted by a doctor over and over again as a kid. They’ve apologized but won’t talk about it with me. The doctor has since died of natural causes; there is no justice.

Nothing makes it better. I drink too much. I have too much sex. Then the pain comes back.

I have everything, and people remind me of that. But still I feel empty. I want it to be over. I don’t want to hurt my family or my boyfriend, but it’s getting harder to resist the urge to end it all. I don’t know what to do. 

Someone, please talk me out of this. My therapist and psychiatrist are doing their best, but I think I’m broken beyond repair.",suicidal,high

But instead I have depression, ocd, autism and no dick but lots of dysphoria and live as an unemployed loser in an institution, it's just... too many things at once, you know? I can't start T until I've been stable for six months, and not being able to start T makes me want to kill myself, it's a vicious cycle that probably will never end. I've wanted to commit suicide since I was twelve, that's a decade in a little over a year. I've got so little hope left. I'm tired. If I had the means to do it, I would, but because I live where I live, there's no access to knifes or medicine. I just go through everyday trying to make the best of it, but it's useless, I'll always just be a burden for everyone, myself included. Society would probably be better off without me, the money they waste on me could go to people who actually could do something with it.

"It's too late to get the life I wantSo I envisioned in myself a great life where I would be married go a lovely, beautiful, wife, have a few kids, live in a nice house and be at the top of my career game. 

Now that seems all but impossible. I recently graduated with a civil engineering degree but I have no job lined up. I accrued internship experience like I was suppose to but no job at the end of the tunnel. I know I should've networked, I would do anything to go back and focus on networking and making a ton of friends in school. 

Now this would be ok if I was 22 or even 24, but I'm not. I'm 27 years old. Starting my career when I am 28 is far too late. I'm 4 years behind everyone else. 

On top of that I don't have as much experience with women as the average guy my age, just a couple girlfriends. Most guys my age have had several fwb, as well as a couple **long term** gfs 

In my observation, most girls over the age of 22 are either taken, massive sluts, overweight, ugly, retarded, or mentally ill. Many times it is a combination. On the other hand, feminists have created a stigma of ""older men"" dating younger women. No one is going to introduce their 20 year old friend to a 30 something year old man as a potential girlfriend. 

Seriously the next time someone says something about age gaps and ""sick old men"" I will bash their baby's head into a wall and tell them this is what it's like to go through some real hardship bitch. I'll laugh and enjoy their sorrow and tell them it is just a splinter compared to the agony I face. 

Luckily I just turned 27 so getting my career started at early 27 is fine but if I don't get started by the end of the summer I'm going to drown myself in a farmer irrigation lake. There's just no way I'm going to be able to live life on my terms. I'm deathly afraid of being alone but I'm also deathly afraid of marrying a ""reformed"" slut and getting divorce raped. 

If anyone knows of someone who started late in life **and** is still married to their first wife who **wasn't hooking up with random men** by all means talk about them. Until then there is no light at the end of the tunnel.

I do the work silently but whenever they have to lift a finger they shout &amp; throw things and create such a toxic atmosphere.

"My parents won't acknowledge my struggles with depression I originally posted this on r/entitledparents, but I was recommended to post it here too. I am 13, going on 14 this year, so I'm technically a teen.

*I* have been struggling with depression from a young age. I have lost all my friends, and am constantly bullied by people telling me I am gay, of which I am straight. My closest friends have turned on me, some I have gotten in a fist-fight with, and others treated me horribly. I have been trying my best to keep myself happy, and I recently have gone into a state of depression. I've been struggling with it since the 7th grade, because I have had horrible experiences with how others have treated me, and I sort of stopped being happy all the time, I lost all of my friends, and became very lonely. Now I have 2 or 3 friends, and I am struggling even more, now that online school is giving me a heck of a time, due to all of the work assigned. I have told my parents about 4 times that I am depressed, and my mom would look at me in horror and scream that I ""NEED HELP"" like I was possessed or something. My parents seem to believe that depression is a phase or sickness and that it goes away after a few days. My only friend doesn't believe me either, and he calls me an ""emo"" or a ""goth"" because of my clothing and my hairstyle. I have been recommended to seek a therapist, but I've already gone through 4 in the 6th and 7th grade. I never felt comfortable because my mother would use therapy as a way to pry into my private life, without asking me herself. My parents also have that mindset that, ""If you buy something, We can take it away because somehow we bought it, even though you raised the money from your neighbors"". I feel confined to only do my parent's bidding like they have my future completely planned out for me, and I have no say in what my future is like. My hatred for them has gotten so bad to the point of me intentionally wanting to fail, academically, socially, and in life. I don't want to succeed because it would be doing the very thing they are trying to force me to do. My mom looks at me like a deranged psychopath, like I'm crazy and need to go to a goddamn mental ward. I have gained a bit of ""corona-weight"" and I have been under a lot of stress from my family accusing me of eating everything in our house, and my mom and dad legit calling me FAT. I can say that I am a little chubby, but I have been doing a lot of boxing, and skating with my friend, and when my mom hears that, she says IM SO PROUD OF YOU. I ask why and she says THATS REALLY HEALTHY, IM SO GLAD YOU'RE FINALLY WORKING OUT.

 I haven't been that stable, mentally, and I am kinda writing this to seek some pointers, on how to deal with all this. I also recently lost my phone while hanging with my friend, so I have no way to contact anyone, and my parents are threatening to take away my only source of communication with my other friends, my pc.",normal,low

"A letter to my grandmother Hey, just a warning, this is kinda sad.

A few years ago, my grandmother was diagnosed with cancer, and she's developed another type since then. She's been going to chemotherapy for a while, but about two months ago, she picked me up and she was wearing a hat. I realized that it was because she had lost her hair and she was afraid what I would think. That broke me inside a little. That really opened my eyes up to the fact that she isn't doing too well and that someday soon I might lose her. It took everything in me to not break down during that visit.
It screwed me up for the next few days. I really didn't know what to do, but I couldn't just say nothing and do nothing. I couldn't just let her go without any effort on my part to love her while she is still here. I've never lost a loved one, and I didn't know how to handle that possibility, but I couldn't let her worry if I'll be okay or not after she leaves. Finally I decided to give her a letter to let her know how I felt. I was really scared because I didn't know if it'd be acceptable to do that, because how do you talk to a person about the fact that you might lose them soon? But I did it, and this is the letter. I'm so glad I gave it to her. 

""Hey Nana,
I love you. I wanna start out with I love you, because I think it's the most important thing to say.
I also really want you to know that no matter what happens, I'll be okay. I know you aren't doing too well, and that you haven't been for a while. And I just want to let you know that even if you pass away, I'll be alright. I'll be sad, yes. It'll hurt, yes. But I want you to know that I'll be okay. I've been through a lot and I'm a strong kid nana. I don't want you to pass away, but I know that everyone has their time. And I really want you to know that when your time comes I'll be alright. Even though it'll hurt a lot, I'll be okay. So please don't worry about me. 
I know I don't come over as often as I should. I really want to fix that, but with this virus going around, and there being so many confirmed cases at [where I live], I don't know if I can safely. I know that normally when I come over I spend most of my time looking at a screen. And I'm sorry about that. I know that when I eat at the dinner table with y'all I'm usually the quiet kid who listens to everyone else speak. And I'm sorry that I don't participate more.
I want you to know that behind every time I've hidden behind a screen or hidden behind my silence, I've been making an effort to show you how much I love you. I'm good with words but I never have been good at speaking my mind, especially when it comes to family. But I want you to know that all of you are so important to me. You are all my family. I've had a lot of people try to fill that role, and no one has been able to do it except for y'all. No one has been able to fill the role you fill except for you. But please know that no matter what happens I'll still be okay. And I'm going to try harder to do better, and be better. 
I remember that one moment where I grabbed your hands and we had a meaningful conversation. I'll never forget that. You said you hated seeing me hurt. I'm doing better now Nana. And I'm gonna continue to get better. I'm always going to have that memory, and because of that I'll always have a piece of you. So please, please, don't worry about me.
I love you Nana. And I hope you have a wonderful day.
Sincerely,
Your grandson""

I was in tears for days when I wrote this and terrified after I gave it to her. I was told the next day that she hadn't read it yet, because she didn't want to cry yet(I told her when I handed it to her that it would be a sad letter). But when I went over after a few days, she just walked up to me, and rubbed me on the back, and went to go sit back down. I didn't know for sure at first whether she read it or not, but now I'm certain. And I'm so happy that I gave it to her, because now, she can know that I'll be okay after she leaves. I just didn't want her to worry. (She's still alive btw. I hope to go over to her house this weekend.)
I avoided posting the letter for a while because I didn't want this to be a publicity stunt or something I did for attention. But some time has passed by, and I want people to know that it's okay to reach out to loved ones like this. It's okay to talk about stuff like this. And personally, I think it would be much better to do it while it they're still with you, than regret it when they're gone and not be able to do anything then.",normal,low

"Never told anyone this before...I shouldn’t be alive today. Remembering this because surprisingly a Rick and Morty episode triggered it. 

At the end of Season 2 episode 3. Rick gets this message from unity that she can’t be with him. Breaks his heart and at the end he ends up trying to kill himself, but at the last moment his alcoholism causes him to pass out causing the laser to miss his head. 

I’m an alcoholic. And like rick. I’ve tried killing myself. I’ve tried ending my life numerous times but fear has always stopped me. 

Well this one night I got so drunk that I didn’t feel much of anything. I didn’t want to leave this world, but I didn’t want to feel the pain anymore. Suicide was my only escape. 

I took this belt and my stool one night and locked myself in the bathroom. My family was far asleep at this time. I felt so empty... everything felt numb. All emotion was gone. And then my feelings disappeared. 

I put a loop in the belt as if you were gonna wear it. Took the end and jammed it between the door and frame. It was very tight and wouldn’t come loose. Put my head through the loop standing up but made it short enough so that when I’d sit or let my body hang the belt would asphyxiate me. I was almost blacking out at the time. Just a matter of time before my mind was blacked out and I’d hang painlessly. Die the way I wish, fall asleep and never wake up again. 

Well like that rick and Morty episode where at last moment ricks head drops and the laser misses. Somehow. Someway my neck managed to break free from the knot. So when I fell I just fell onto the ground. 

I woke up very early the next morning alive and sick. Put everything away before they could see what happened. I was astonished to be alive and sometimes feel so guilty. 

I guess what I’m saying is that the episode really messed me up. I remember watching it and tearing up. Because I know that pain. 

Just needed to get that off my chest... ",suicidal,high

"Thinking that it might be time to kill myselfFor the past two hours, I've been sitting here with my gun in my purse, wondering if tonight's the night to kill myself. I live with the idea that I will, eventually, kill myself, not just because life sucks but also because I'm a pretty awful person and killing me would be doing the world a favor. So in my mind, it's not a matter of if I'll kill myself...it's when I'll kill myself.

Life just . . . keeps pushing me further into a corner where I can't escape from. I've got Type II Bipolar Disorder and Borderline Personality Disorder. I'm a fucking mess. Currently in therapy, but no meds because my insurance switched and this therapy place won't prescribe meds until you spend two months in therapy. Therapy is okay, not really doing a whole lot for me. I have some left over meds from my last foray into therapy. Take a pill about once or twice a week. It allows me to function somewhat throughout the week.

Biggest issue that's driving me to suicide? My mother-in-law. It's super complicated, but long story short, she used to not like me and I put in a huge effort to be friends with her. Got engaged and she flipped out, said she hoped we'd just break up. Thinks I'm childish for having mental illnesses and not keeping everything bottled up inside. My husband knows his mom is crazy but these days, even he thinks I ought to just get over all the emotional abuse she's put me through and just be friends with her. Which I literally cannot do. Being in the same room as her makes me anxious. Even typing this I'm starting to shake. 

I often manage to convince myself that I'm in the right here. I know I wasn't right about everything, but trying to avoid contact with someone who thinks so poorly of me and was (and sometimes still is) emotionally abusive? I feel like I'm right to do that. But my husband disagrees, he thinks I need to get over it. Of course he's too kind to say it like that, but that's the gist of it.

If I kill myself, I remove a toxic part of the equation. Sure, my husband will be super upset about it, but there will no longer be than tension in the household (we live with his mom because everyone is poor). I won't be stealing him away from time he could spend helping her. And him helping her matters, because she has very advanced multiple sclerocis. I won't be taking up time, food, money. I won't have to figure out what the fuck I'm doing in college and how I'm suppose to turn it into a career that'll make enough money to feed and house us. The fact that we only have one car won't be an issue. I won't make my husband miserable anymore by existing. 

I really need to talk to someone about this. And I don't have anyone. My husband is mad at me because of the broken relationship between his mom and me. I have two friends I've talked to when I'm feeling suicidal before, but they can't really take it. The last time I talked to each of them they freaked out. I don't feel that I know anyone else well enough to bring this up. I mean, someone you don't talk to much or who seems fairly normal-ish just ups and messages you ""Hey I have a gun and I want to kill myself and I really need to talk to someone, you got a few minutes?"" I hate it when I can't talk to my husband about stuff. I talk to him about most everything. But suicide? He just freaks out about it. 

I feel like this post went nowhere. Thats feels about right, though. Everything feels vague and directionless and . . . I don't know, like I'm wading through water and there's nowhere to go. ",suicidal,high

"Told my dad I was suicidal and he did nothingI (20F) often get bullied by the rest of my family (I have four brothers, only girl). For one reason or another, everything is always my fault. 

First off, my oldest brother (32M) wrote me off for good last year because he asked me to give his ex girlfriend’s belongings back to her. He would do this a lot, and one time he asked I didn’t have the time (I was a caregiver and had a 12hr shift). He told me that since he co-signed for my car that I should’ve had his back, and said I wasn’t family.

My two other brothers (26M) (24M) live with him and are basically sheep, and took his side. I found out that the 24 y/o actually agreed with me, but didn’t have the guts to say anything. 

The 26 y/o sexually assaulted me when I was a child, and was horrible to me for years. He just apologized for everything a few months ago, so I guess he’s trying to make amends.

My youngest brother (19M), I thought, was my best friend. We frequently get into arguments because he doesn’t have a car and I always take him everywhere. I honestly don’t mind, but he gets into these moods where it seems like my very existence is a bother to him. Last week I overheard him telling my dad how annoying I was, and I’ll admit, it hurt me. I take care of him like my own (my mom left us when I was 15- she was a drug addict and child abuser).

After the argument, I told my dad that I wanted to die because everybody around me hated me. He said “why would you do that to me?” and criticized me for not getting any help. I did make an appointment to see a psychiatrist, but I don’t know if I can make it to Sunday. Nobody has checked on me all week. I could’ve killed myself two days ago and no body would’ve noticed.

So when I was 18 I left home to move 60+miles away from the small village I grew up in. I left as I was pressured into going to university by my college and my parents despite not know what path I wanted to take in life yet. So I go, 3 years of pure hell. I never wanted to be there, I lost all interest in my course but again was pressured to staying via family, finances and friends. 

The hell of uni was finally over I finished my degree with a 2:2 so I mean I may as well of not even bothered in the first place right? Anyway the only good thing to come out if it was meeting my now ex girlfriend. We where together for 4 years and when I was with her, I just seemed to know what I was doing. I was acting for us, we had a vision and I was determined to see it through. I worked 2 jobs, supported her when she left jobs abruptly and put myself in financial termoil to support and provide for her. she had mental health issues and by no means was a treat to deal with mostly but I loved her, my love saw through all of that. Anyway I started going through a bad time personally, I could feel her love slipping away, arguments became more frequent the amount of pressure I was under became higher and in the end I just dove in a hole and smoked weed. 

For me it was all I had, I knew I was loosing the love of women I worked so hard to provide and care for and genuinely wanted to spend my life with but could feel it all slipping away. Anyway around the time I was slipping her life started to get better and stuff started falling into place for her. She landed a good job (again after me supporting her for a month or two through walking out of her old one) I'd basically paid for her to travel Thailand for a month while I stayed home to look after the pets and sort stuff out because it was a life goal of hers and I didn't want to stand in the way. 

Then boom it happens, I was surplus to requirements. She left me, she didn't come for anything from the flat I had to cart it all and pack it all up and take it to her dad's. I knew at the time it was permanent that she was done with me, I couldn't fully explain why. I wasn't perfect in that moment I was in a very bad spot, and yes I was smoking weed but that was to cope with the stress of working 2 jobs, paying the bills and trying to clear of our joint debt (which I foolishly let in my name). But I certainly don't feel I deserved to be treated the way I was treat after everything. 

So my family (who at this point I've barley spoken to for years) they'd pop up every now and then but never sort of asked how things where or picked up on me not being right. I lost a lot of weight due to stress, instantly they put this down to me being on heroin or cocaine, even though I've never touched either. I've only smoked weed. But anyway they asked me to move home and ever since again I just feel a burden.

I left my job due to it being too stressful and me taking on additional work due to the COVID 19 scenario and fixed the proceedure to make it better for employees. Received no thanks, no payments no nothing just a bunch of lip of employees etc on why we where even doing it etc. So I left.

Ever since I've moved back home every week I have a battle with myself where I just want to end it all. I honestly don't know what to do anymore. I've got the means to do it and I really want to do it. The only thing stopping me at the moment is caring for my rabbit, guinea pig and dog. 

I just dont feel I belong on this earth anymore, I feel I've overstayed my welcome and I've nothing left to give. I have no motivation, no desire, no passions, everyday I become more and more bitter and resentful that I'm still here suffering. 

I've surrendered to the fact I don't think I can find happiness again, I really don't want to live, but I don't want to be seen as selfish if I take my own life. As that's seems to be the main theme I see, is that people who want out are selfish for causing pain and suffering to others. But if we are in this much pain and suffering ourselves surely isn't it not selfish to ask us to stick around on the whim things may get better but probably won't and endure this heart wrenching pain and suffering of being a disappointment, failure, ass hat, good for nothing peice of shit human.

"Tell parents? [29 M]Given my age maybe the question is a little surprising. 

I live on my own and while I'm not an utter fuckup, I'm a major disappointment given the expectations that were put on me. I'm a disappointment to myself, too. Trying to explain what happened would just sound like a bunch of excuses, but basically I've spent years alone accomplishing nothing, despite having many things I'm interested in and want to do.

Recently I felt the time pressure of age and tried to see what it would take to actually do those things I wanted to do. The more I've looked into it, the more despondent I get, as I see how many ships have sailed. I'm just not that interested in living a life full of regrets. I'm being sort of lazy with the descriptions because I don't really ""just need to talk."" I put myself into a corner where I'll never be who I thought I would be. Nobody can turn back time for me.

The question is just, should I tell my parents about it in advance? Would that be really inappropriate? I don't want it to sound like I'm trying to manipulate them into bailing me out or something, but if they have time to process it, maybe that would help.",suicidal,high

"Failing a class while on academic probation, I feel utterly hopeless. I don’t know what to doI’m at the end of my rope. I’m a 21 female year old university student and my university career has been an utter failure so far. I have ADHD, but I can’t take any stimulants because the crash from them makes me too morose to function. My first year, I was in a great books programme- I loved it, but unfortunately I got very depressed towards the end and ended up getting an ILL. I took time off from school, took classes at a local university near my home (didn’t go stellar in a couple classes there either), and was accepted back at my original university. I’m doing average in the rest of my classes, but I just found out that I will undoubtedly fail one of the classes I’m in. I missed a test, immediately emailed the professor to schedule a retake (one is allowed), and did not hear back from her- or so I thought. I’m such a scatterbrained idiot that I missed her email for an entire week-DESPITE CHECKING FOR IT- and emailed her back a week ago asking if I could retake it. I heard nothing back until today, when I emailed her asking if she received my email. She told me she would not allow me to retake the test because I had “consistently failed” to respond to her emails even though she hadn’t responded to mine for a week. I also found out I missed an assignment for that class. There are four assignments total. I am going to fail this class and probably be kicked out of university. I don’t know what to do- I had such big dreams and so much potential but I’ve ruined it all. I’m Catholic and I don’t believe in suicide, but I see no other option going forward right now. I don’t know what to do. I just cut myself for the first time in my life.

The guy that I talked to yesterday started to warm up to me more. We hung out during break with another student who was in a similar situation to me.

"Hate how just a few kids have to answer the teacher during online class while the others don’t give a flying fuck Excuse any typos since this is typed on phone.
Being in a high school and typically the last year of it, has been sad overall. So ever since online classes have begun, every single class has had only some students answer or respond to the teacher while the others just take the back seat and can’t seem to care less. This is extremely unfair because the teacher is teaching the whole class and not just the 2 or 3 who actually bother to respond. Like, why care to attend the class then if you aren’t even going to pay attention? Stop wasting your parents’ hard earned money and time and energy if you’re just going to chill while not contributing shit to the class. Moreover, upon being summoned by the teacher, the audacity to lie about your mic not working but otherwise using it to speak on your private calls is just outrageous. It’s not like the students who actually answer are paid to do so, or for paying attention or something. So, yeah.

"Abusive dad and money issues. I can't handle it.My dad is and has always been verbally and physically abusive. My mom lives with him and enables his behavior because she has no choice, he is the one who makes money. He has never had any close friends since I've been alive. If someone ever came to the house when I was growing up, he would run and hide to avoid. He still does this, even if it's the pizza delivery guy coming to the door. At work, he is very quiet and everyone there thinks he is just mild-mannered polite guy. As soon as he gets home, he is a different person. Because of this, I have NO witnesses that could see his behavior. I've always suspected he has something like Borderline Personality Disorder. My family would never admit to something like this as they live in denial about everything.

Last week, I was in a pinch and had to borrow a couple hundred dollars. This is NOT something that happens regularly, or ever at all. It made me sick to ask and I felt terrible, but let me be clear he has PLENTY of money and this is not hurting him by any means. Asking made me humiliated and he made sure to let me know how bad I should feel. Since I haven't been able to pay it back yet, he called me yesterday screaming and throwing a fit and sent me a bunch of horrible messages about how awful I am. This is nothing new as he has always been known to have complete freak outs over little issues and blow everything out of proportion.

I have some serious bills piling up and cannot make the payments plus the rent I need for this month. I am working full-time but everything is just too much. I desperately want to take out a loan but I haven't established my credit for long enough. The only thing I can do is go stay with them.

I am so scared of having to go stay with him and have my dog and myself get abused. The last time we visited, my puppy gets very excited to see people, and he had a meltdown from the dog resting his chin next to him on the couch. He started hitting my freaking puppy over it!! Over just wanting attention/to be petted. It was horrifying. It's so hard to explain his personality because everything is like, ""How could you do that?"" He has serious rage issues that he's never been able to control and he flips out over tiny things. Then afterwards, he would act like nothing happened. It's coming down to my only option of having to stay with him and I've been up for days crying about it. For anyone who's lived with mental/physical abusers, you know that just being around these people deteriorates your mental health and causes permanent damage.

If I didn't have my dog, I would 100% commit suicide. After a lifetime of dealing with abuse, and the stress of money issues, I can't take it anymore.",suicidal,high

"I'm an assholeI have a girlfriend. She's easily the best I could ever ask for. I do nothing but treat her wrongly. I was a furry for a while. She specifically asked me to stop, as she didn't like that. It was understandable, but I just couldn't. I finally did after like 3 times. It shouldn't have taken me that long. I didn't deserve that many chances. I lied to her every time. ""Yeah. It's over."" ""No, I don't do that anymore"" ""No. I'm not lying."" I even got caught red-handed and lied anyways.

And now, I overreact to things. Every time I mess up. I apologise too much. Every time she says something about me, I get overly defensive.

Today, she called me a weeb as a joke, because I like anime and the likes (yeah even the NSFW) and I took it far too seriously and we got into a large argument which ended in her telling me (paraphrasing) ""I don't care that you are one... I just hope you grow out of it."" She doesn't want to talk to me now... She blocked me. She told me not to come see her in the morning (I usually pick her up for school)

I don't think I will grow out of it. This is what worries me right now. I don't want it to be the furry thing all over again.
I don't want to break up with her. She's the absolute love of my life. I don't deserve her, which honestly makes me want her more. It's kinda like when you get a really good gift when you really didn't deserve it. You cherish it more because it was given to you anyways.

I'm so tired of messing things up. I mess things up in all my social relationships. This is not the only one I've messed up in. This is just the most recent example. I don't know when to stop. I'm a chronic liar. I'm just so tired of myself. I hate myself. I hate how I am. I hate that I do this.

I've contemplated suicide many times. This is def not my first time. I've even attempted it before. A bag over the head doesn't work. You panic and rip it off.

Why even go on? Why continue living if all I do is hurt those around me.

I'm not benefiting the world in any way. I'm not benefiting my gf in any way. I'm not benefiting my friends in any way. Why continue living if all I am is a parasite to those I care about? I take all their love and affection and help and I give back nothing. I only ever show them even more that I don't deserve it.

I think about how they would feel if I ended my life. I think they'd be sad, of course, but I feel like they'd get over it. I've had a family member die. It still hurts, but it's a dull pain. One that I've grown accustomed to. I feel like it'll become that to them too. I don't think this sadness would ever be as bad as what I've caused them before.

"Need to ventSuicidal thoughts aren't new to me. When I was younger and I would face any kind of real hardship the thoughts would creep in. I would think about family and friends and how their life would change and I would be immediately snapped out of the fantasy of death. As the years went by I kept the self destruct button locked away, only to be brought out in times of true duress. 2 years ago I made my first attempt. Actually it was more of an attempt at an attempt. I sat in my bath tub after using a razor to scratch into my arms and thighs. I was never brave enough to do deep damage. I contemplated and contemplated while the water turned cold. I looked over at my hair dryer and the thoughts set in. The cord was long enough to dip in the water and I eventually let in drop in. Obviously it did not work. I had not known that hair dryers these days were made different now so they weren't effective in suicide attempts. Since that moment I've been scared. Scared that I actually had the strength to allow myself to die. Currently I feel as though I'm at a low I've never been to before. I've had depressive episodes before but they were few and far between. It would just feel like I was not comfortable and it was manifesting in a 'gaping hole' feeling in the pit of my stomach. I just felt empty. It didn't last long but this one has. I've taken to distracting myself with drugs alcohol tv and friends but each day it feels like it works less and less. I try not to be one of the people that only look at the negative but I've spent a lot of time thinking about each aspect of my life and finding that I am discontent with each and every single one. I've kept myself alive all this time because I was able to find one thing, at least one thing, worth living for. Now I try and I just feel apathetic. The odds are stacking up against me and my pretty little self destruct button is looking a lot better by the passing day. I'm scared of tomorrow. So scared that I'm considering ending today.

This time I'm very scared may be different. 

I could sit here and list all the things that are wrong with my life, but I feel like that's just a competition in sadness. I know I don't have the worst life on earth- I just have the worst life for me.

I'm 30, on the brink of being very very lonely- the one person who was there for me seems to want to head for the exit and as such leaves me with no one. I took a risk... after all the horrible horribleness of my life before him I didn't know I could try one more time... and I did... and now I'm paying for it.

There's an incident I can pinpoint where I should have died about 5 years ago, and everyday I think the fates that be made a mistake. If energy cannot be created or destroyed... then I feel like all I am doing is preventing someone or something else from living that could do better with this energy than me. 

I'd say I have nothing to look forward to- I do. It's just every time the darkness follows. For once in my life I was entirely completely loved and happy... and now I find myself in a lower pit then I even began.

I'm thinking the week after next might be a good time to go for it, because it's the 2nd anniversary of my mother's death and if there is something after this, maybe I have her to go to.

"TIFU Suicide watch editionSunday, which seems so long ago, I took a handful of pills and tearfully went to sleep in the hope that I could finally get some peaceful sleep that I felt I truly needed. A small part of me also hoped that I wouldn't wake up because I had let everyone down, including myself. 

My boss found me because I'm staying with them and had missed the beginning of my shift and I lead a group of 25 people  who were waiting on me. 

Cue firemen, ambulance, lots of shouting, and a trip to the hospital. 

I'm ok now and I was able to talk myself out of the traditional 72 hour hold because I do have an amazing support system of friends and already existing docs. Oh, and maybe the fact that I'm uninsured and the county facility didn't have beds helped too. 

But I'm frustrated and angry that I'm back to step one. I don't have a job anymore. A job that I loved but was honestly too stressful for me to handle. My friends are either treating me with kiddie gloves because they're afraid I'll break again or are unaware of what's going on so they think I'm just ignoring them. I feel aimless. So so aimless. When all I wanted was a nap to reset myself and cope with the pressure I was facing. It was such a stupid mistake that I made and the repercussions were so great. 

I just feel stuck. Not suicidal thankfully but just so stuck.",suicidal,high

"Post-grad depressedI went to art school because it was my passion and it was the only thing that kept me in school. But now Im out and the lack of jobs coupled with the debt is going to be the end of me. 

I only work a part time job due to mental health issues, and I really enjoy my job right now. But my payments to debt are slowly approaching and I have no real way to take care of it. My moms offering to help out a bit (so long as I pay her back) but the feeling of being a burden on anyone, let alone my mom (again) doesn’t exactly sit well with me.

I’m kicking myself for art school (animation major) because its not practical and it was so expensive but I loved what I was doing there. I can’t imagine myself doing anything else. But getting work in that field (any field really) is so hard. A part of me I wish I sucked it up and did something practical like a teacher or a I.T. worker, but I know for a fact I’d have ended at this exact spot either way. 

I have plans, I know what I need to do to off and have access to the stuff to off myself with, but I’m scared. I’m not scared to die, I’m afraid of what its going to do to the people I love. Otherwise I’d be gone by now.

I just feel trapped. Sorry if any of this sounds complain-y. Thanks for reading.",suicidal,high
"Easing the pain left behindI wish i'd died 4 years ago, that's when I left the house with the intention to kill myself, i'd have saved everyone a lot of suffering if I had and by now i'd be largely forgotten and the benefits of my absence would be obvious... I couldn't go through with it though, my father was out of the country on a work trip at the time and the thought of him getting that phone call when they dragged my body out of the reservoir was enough to make me reconsider. I concluded that I hadn't tried everything yet, How could I do something that I knew would cause so much grief to him if I hadn't tried everything first? He didn't even know I was depressed, it'd have come completely out of the blue.  


It took another 15 months before I was able to tell my father I was depressed. Every year we have a big family get together at Christmas, and I just couldn't face seeing them all that year and obviously he wanted to know why not. It was a short conversation and very little was actually said, I couldn't tell him I had a plan, that i'd tried on several occasions to write a suicide note, that I'd once left the house with the intention never to return home or that he was the only reason I was still here... it was too hard.

At my request, he agreed to push me, nag me, until I reached out for help. I needed someone to push me, I was clearly incapable of reaching out if left to my own devices, much to my shame. It took a few months to get there but I eventually made an appointment with my GP who referred me to a therapist, with a 6 month waiting list. I waited, counting down the days. After 1 short session I was recommended anti-depressants but declined, You see, I'd quit my job a couple of years earlier, which I no longer felt able to do, as it had only further fuelled my depression. I started to accumulate debt and had my account frozen. I stopped opening the letters... all letters... They never had anything in them that didn't make me feel worse. I'm entirely financially dependant on my father. I didn't have the money to pay for the prescription.

I went down to the bank to try and get a new account, but I didn't have the required identification... which I could't afford to purchase... I can't get an account without I.D and I can't get I.D without money, which I can't get without an account for it to go into. That broke me, It'd taken so much effort to try and change my situation and I failed at the first hurdle.  


After a couple more sessions, the therapist suggested a break from weekly appointments whilst I looked for a solution... I never went back... It had proved fruitless anyway, amounting to being told ""set yourself daily goals, and do them"". I felt that I was a lost cause, that his time was better spent on someone who he may actually be able to help.

I'm not sure how long it's been since then, but here I am, still staring at a screen each day until I can go to sleep, the same as every other day for the best part of a decade, still locking myself away, not leaving the house, barely even leaving my bedroom. I isolated myself from everyone else years ago, but my fathers the one person who I can't push away as I live with him.  


 I can't keep doing it anymore, I tried to get better for his sake, and have failed spectacularly, So I no longer feel like I haven't done enough to try and have begun my final preparations. I've started the monumental task of tidying my room after years of neglect (it's not hoarders level, but it's not pleasant). It's one less thing he'll have to do when i'm gone, one less thing for me to feel guilty about. I'm chipping away at it when I have the energy, but I can't do much before I'm exhausted. Then it's wiping my computers HDD's, which i'll do on my last day... There's nothing I'm trying to hide, I'd just rather not have someone invading my privacy as weird as that sounds.  
 My suicide plan has changed over the years, which i think is the one positive thing to come out of my failure to commit to it last time, I can hang myself right here, listening to music, that feels better than walking for hours and drowning myself in a dark unfamiliar place for some poor random soul to find me. I can leave my father a warning at the start of my suicide note telling him what I've done, and not to enter my room as well as what to expect when he calls 999... I don't imagine that'll stop him rushing into my room and discovering my body himself (something I wanted to avoid) but i'll throw a bag over my head and tuck it under the rope so at least he won't see my disfigured face. 

It's just the rest of my suicide note that I'm still really struggling with it. I'm really worried about my dad in the immediate aftermath of my death, and I want to do whatever i can to ease his suffering, I want to be able to answer any questions he has, to ensure he doesn't blame himself in any way. I want to express how sorry I am and that I have to believe he'll find a way to be okay long enough for the initial grief to fade and the reality that he's better off without me being a burden to begin to show. I don't want to come across as demanding anything from him though, I don't want him to feel ever feel that he's failed me or betrayed my wishes.

  
I know this'll be the last thing i'll ever say to him, and that he'll likely read it over and over again, trying to pick out every bit of meaning from it, so i'm picking over every word trying to get it just right so it can't be misinterpreted as anything but something that's trying to bring him some comfort. Every time I think I've got it right, i read it back a few hours later and it doesn't seem like it's enough...",suicidal,high

"Will probably ""opt out"" soon.Waiting for the electricity and water to be cut off. Only a few more days until my phone is cut off. Sitting in a house that was abandoned by my mother since she couldn't make payments anymore. She just moved away to a relative's house. Who knows when the bank will be by to do whatever. I don't have a car anymore, a job, or any money so there is nothing I can do. I won't be homeless again. I've tried to apply to some places I could walk to, but I haven't heard anything back. My work history is pretty bad because I can't seem to hold onto jobs, and last job I had was years ago. Can't get disability either, even though depression and anxiety have destroyed my life and kept me from being able to take care of myself. 

I have a cat I can't take care of anymore and I don't know what to do with her. It's sad and pathetic, but I can't bear to be without my cat. Like me, she was homeless for a while, a stray, and I adopted her because I needed a friend. 

None of my friends care. They know my situation but there's nothing they can do. I know they may care, but my depression tells me something else. No one ever even texts me to see how I am doing. 

It's been an awful year for me. Worst ever. I've already posted why in lots of other threads. I am just too tired, hopeless, lazy, sad to post all of the bad things that have happened. 

There is a gun in the house. I am making myself as comfortable as possible for a few days before hand just so I can probably go out in relative peace and comfort. I think I will somehow post a message on Facebook just before I do it, asking someone to get my cat and do something with her. They can take any possessions I have left to sell to use as compensation. I won't need them, obviously.

"I can't ignore it anymoreI'm 18 and I've already completely fucked my life up. My entire childhood was horrible. I fucking hated secondary school and I have nightmares about it constantly. I just wish I could go back and change everything, or at least be able to remove the memories from my conscience. I've done nothing but fuck up my entire life. I drove away the only person I ever truly bonded with. He loved me until I put him off me with my neurotic personality. Every night I wish I could hold him again. I'm an embarrasment to my parents. They might not even think that themselves but I am. I'm fucking useless. I've never accomplished anything even when I've tried.

I got my A Level results back a few days ago and they were below mediocre. Two Cs and a D. I wasn't surprised though, I know I didn't revise anywhere near as much as I should have. 

Not that it even matters anyway, because they were in worthless subjects (History, Politics and Law). I chose those subjects because I took the stupid advice of my parents who said they had ""transferable skills"". What a load of fucking bollocks. They're probably lying to me to make me feel better about not being good enough. 

And before anyone asks ""well, why didn't you take any STEM subjects?"" - I wanted to. Unfortunately, that choice wasn't available to me because I didn't pass my GCSE in maths. And I think that's one of my greatest weaknesses, my dyscalculia. I was forced to resit it three times and didn't pass until I sat the foundation paper like some sort of fucking spastic. 

The only way to earn any real amount of money nowadays is through getting a STEM degree, and that's off the table because of my inability to do mental maths. And you know what? I've tried coding with Python before and I have no problem with it, but having difficulty with arithmetic is enough to shut the entire field from me in the professional sphere. 

I know I have a bleak future ahead of me. What is there that I could do? If all that's open to me is working behind a counter in McDonald's or stacking shelves at Tesco for the next half century then I'll walk in front of a fucking bus. Just the thought of having to live here for the rest of my life is enough to make me scream. I fucking hate this city, it's full of white trash and scummy chavs. 

At this point all I want to do is make my parents proud of me, and for them to not think that they poured 18 years of effort into a failure. But I know I won't. I'll never amount to anything and I know it. I'm useless and incompetent. I don't even deserve the life that I already have.

Then next to me on the other side an old guy pulled up, really old and kept playing his radio!

"When is it okay to stop fighting?I guess no one will really tell me when because that's probably against the rules of this sub, but I need a bit of venting, I guess. 

I'm 24 and I've been suffering from chronic pain issues for about two years now (and before that, too, but just not this bad). I can work part time but providing for myself is hard. If I've got to work, I'm not able to do groceries or cook or have social activities. Nor am I able to make full work days because my body sucks. 

I've been suicidal for almost a year now and decided after a month or so I'd not go down without a fight. I've been trying to see doctors (little did I know that even the most physical symptoms can be caused by depression, even if depression came after those symptoms. Isn't that fascinating?) and I've been seeing a psychologist for about half a year now. I still want to die every freaking day. 

I know suicide is a ""final solution to a temporary problem"", and I need to view my situation in a different light and what not - but I can't keep fighting until I die of natural causes. I just want to give up and just... end everything on my own terms. Of course I feel guilty about leaving people behind, but this isn't a life I want to live. I cannot go living while being in pain every single day, not being able to do what I'd loved to do, being stuck in bed for most hours of the week that I don't spend at my job. I cannot provide for myself, but there will be a moment that my current roommates will move out and I'd need to. I don't want to be put in a care centre where even suicide won't be an option anymore. 

I'm just done fighting, I guess. I'm not giving up tomorrow, but I'm definitely planning out the way I'd like to go, planning the letters I'm gonna write, saying goodbye (without saying goodbye) to everyone I love (social distancing, of course).

But within being my best friend they are also my first love. However unlike most of those friendships they've known sense like a month into our friendship that I like them, and over time I gradually fell in love with they, this they know too.

But still our friendship is going strong with us both loving each other, them loving me as a friend and me loving them as a potential romantic partner. And the thing is we are crystal clear on where the other one stands, and want the best for each other, so it hurts us both to see each other hurt because of the way we each feel.

"Does it really get betterI've been depressed longer than I can remember now but it's been so much worse the past few months... 

I never thought about suicide. I used to have the thinking of I just wish I was never born, or could dissappear and have everyone's memory erased. I know my family love me I do but somehow it doesnt matter.

I know killing myself will hurt my family but now I'm starting to think it might be worth it.. they'll suffer, be sad, it will hurt for a month really bad, but then they'll get better - go on to leave a better life without me around. Really it would be a favour, a few months of grief for a better life overall..

I don't know what to do anymore I'm so sick I can't remember the last time I was truly happy

It's so dumb my problems aren't worse than others - I hate my job in overweight blah blah blah.. so what? Lots.of people hate their job, lots of people struggle with the same struggles I do

Yet why do the same struggles make me want to not exist.. to kill myself?? Because I am weak? I mean I don't even know

I haven't even tried medication using drugs yet so maybe I should just go down that route first... make sure I suffer some more before I leave?

Or maybe I shouldn't leave and live with suffer for the rest of my.life because that's what I deserve?

I'm so confused. I hate my life I hate other people because I'm jealous I hate that the one person I've told about my depression is so good about it when I've told them to leave so many times... to the point where I'm considering just blocking her on Facebook because I don't deserve that..

"Alternatives to r/SuicideWatchDear r/SuicideWatch, I think this is a truly fantastic place, but there have been times when I've really wanted someone to talk to anonymously but SW wasn't appropriate. Such reasons include:

* **Problems unrelated to suicide**. I'm not sure what the scope of appropriate topics is for SW. Obviously anything related to suicide or serious depression belongs here, but what about other topics which are of concern to the poster but have nothing to do with suicide?
* **Lack of privacy**. Although I can make a throwaway account and be anonymous, every post here is publicly available, so posting a lot of detailed information can be risky.
* **Delayed responses**. I know that there are phone numbers provided for emergencies, but these numbers aren't appropriate for non-emergencies, and do not have the same level of anonymity.

I think it would help me (and hopefully many others) if we built a list of alternative resources for when SW isn't the most appropriate place to go. Such alternatives could include:

* Relevant forums
* Relevant IRC channels
* Relevant Chatrooms
* Relevant subreddits
* Contact details of people willing to provide support

If this has been done before and was successful, or if you think it won't be helpful please let me know.

"I have suicidal thoughts but don't actually want to die (LONG /VENT)(TRIGGER: PEDOPHILIA /MOLESTATION) 

these thoughts have been going around since the third year of middle school (italy). i got made fun of how i dressed and since then i value other's people judgment a lot. this made me develop a really bad stutter and sometimes i can't even get the words out of my mouth because they just won't come out (selective mutism probably) and also really bad social anxiety. I'm really young and i feel that I'm wasting my childhood/teenhood whatever (I'm 15). I've been to two schools and i literally can't make a lot of friends /keep up conversations or friendships. when i go out or just browse my instagram story or just read the class chat i get so sad, because it feels like I'm just a spectator, just watching and doing nothing. they tell jokes, they easily talk to others, they aren't afraid of speaking up. even the quietest kid in class has more balls than me. this social anxiety also makes me the clown of the situation. like i want to be serious and actually speak some intelligent things or something, but instead i just say jokes, talk in a really sweet voice and i make some really cringy gestures like I'm some anime girl protagonist. 

 i also don't trust people. like i constantly fear of being molested or sexualized by literally everyone when it's not true. i think that this is because (I'm not really sure) i was molested when i was really young. there was this guy who worked (and still does)  in my dads factory that would just come to me and touch my ass. i still remember everything so clearly. all the cringy shit i did, this etc.


today i just told my mom about this and i cried for the whole day (not the molestation). i told her that i want to see a therapist and i convinced her to take me to one once this pandemic is slowing down.

 I'm not scared of dying alone, in fact i just want to be left alone forever. my biggest dream is to live in an house in the middle of a forest surrounded by trees and things where I'll just be there. but also i want to be noticed by people. (i know I'm a big ass egoistic narcissistic or something). how is this feeling called? to be ignored but also noticed? 

i don't want to die tho. i have so many things to do and want to see and death scares me tf out of me. two months ago i started an art account and so far I'm at 120 followers and got a lot of commissions, and this makes me really happy because i want to be a professional digital artist in the future. I'm also debating if i should just ignore all the relationships bullshit and just concentrate 100% on my art for myself, but like i said before I'm really young and i dont want to waste these times. 

but sometimes i think of just jumping out of the window and just ""splat"" even though i will never do it.

if you read this far i hope the best for you",suicidal,high

"im terrified that i wont cry when my parents die they’re completely healthy and fine currently. should live for another 20 or 30 years. 

the first time i experienced death was at 12 when my goldfish died. i didnt care at all. “oh well” i remember thinking. i also remember my dad saying jokingly “i hope you show a little bit more emotion when i die!”

two years ago my grandpa died. we were very close and i held his hand as he died. i was conscious of the fact that i wasn’t particularly upset. i was bummed to see my family so upset but i had to force myself to cry when the time finally came because everyone else was and it really scared me. 

this morning my dad texted me and said that my grandma had been sent to the hospital for unknown reasons. she goes to the hospital a lot, but this time seems different because hes not very religious and told me to pray for her. of course i hope shes ok and i did pray, but my first thought upon hearing this was “i hope this doesnt affect my plans for tonight”. what the fuck kind of reaction is that????

so now im realizing that i might feel the same way when my parents die. the greatest people ive ever known and i will feel indifferent when they leave. does anyone else feel like this or know why i feel like this? thanks",normal,low

"it just seems like my only optioni've always been suicidal or at least obsessed with the idea of making everything stop since i was still in single digits, what i can remember of that time anyway, trauma blocks out a lot 

the frantic urge has waxed n waned depending on ym life circumstances but most days even on good days or weeks or months i still wake up and my first thoughts are ""fuck. you woke up. aren't you tired? you could just. do it today you know. so easy. and then you never have to wake up again! u won't have to handle everything yourself! there will be nothing to handle!"" but like depression and lonliness n abuse are one thing. u can get help for that you can heal that you can fix that you can push through that. but physical pain and immobility is another for me. i'm kind of sickly and i'm in my mid 20's and it just feels like - actually not just feels. it is. no matter how hard i work on my health and fitness my body seems bent on failing me and honestly i see the potentially vast expanse of my life stretchhing before me and it just gets darker and more painful. i thought once i lost all the weight or once i started really investing in my mental health and healing things would be different. better. 

it's not. i still want to die all the time, and this year has just. calmed the urge, but also solidified it. made me sure it's the right path for me. 

it always felt unfair that i can't just. check out because of obligations to other people. but i'm starting to get over that. my family n friends will be fine you know?  i'm no one's first priority anyway and people r resilient and can recover emotionally from just about anything and so can i. but this is less about my brain and more about my body and i've got to the point where i'm no longer thinking about a lifetime of shoddy pain management and failed rehabilitation and i spend most of my time considering my options for not being here shortly. how to make it as smooth or Sure as possible, how to make sure its not just an attempt. it feels right and it feels inevitable and it feels. comforting. 

i can't wait to not suffer, honestly. mentally, physically, emotionally. all of it. 

i don't know. i don't feel panicked anymore, i only feel panicked when i think about. being here. having to ccontinue to be here. now i feel like, okay. what's another little while of pain for an endless expanse of peace right? i don't know. i know how it sounds and i know how upset i would be if someone i loved just wanted to end it but i feel like. i'd also be happy for them? i'm not sure. probably not. maybe i would just want people to be happy for me. that i'm finally doing the only thing ive ever wanted to do. rest. 

i think i just wanted to share as i don't have the means to access counselling/therapy services and can't share these thoughts with my friends or brother without terrifying/alerting them. did not feel ""in crisis"" enough to try a hotline, thank you for reading and maybe understanding",suicidal,high

"That dark place againRewind a few years back, I fell into a deep depression, lost my job, friends, family don't understand much as I am the ""black sheep"" of the family. 

I attempted suicide by cutting my wrists but a friend dropped in and well saved me. (Sounds too good to be true I know but used to live in a place where I had an open door policy for friends. Call it good timing or something else).

Anyway, with the help of antidepressants and support I moved, got a new job, and started feeling... Good. Until recently.

I work in the public sector protecting student data in schools across the UK and investigate data breaches etc. I love my job however public sector don't pay too well. I rent a house with my partner and dogs (these guys got me through my previous depression) however now the landlord is rasing the cost per month as well as now asking for a deposit to be put down. Or else we will have to leave.

I have no savings, I barely make ends meet, everything seems to be going wrong and breaking. And it's all at once. I can feel myself falling back into my depression. I've been suffering with headaches from stress of being kicked out and my career suffering from this, I've been taking painkillers (codeine) and keep upping the dose each time to numb myself.

I know this isn't as dire as other people's problems but I've always tried to be a good person and make a difference in the world but it feels the world kicks me each time I stand up.

"I didn't commit suicideThis is a little update from my post of a few weeks back.

In the end, I didn't kill myself.

I planned everything out and I wanted to kill myself on the 10th of August, a month after the death of my friend Eli.
That day at 2 AM I woke up and went to the bathroom with a knife and stayed there for a good hour looking at myself in the mirror.

I don't know what happened but I started thinking about my family and I forgot everything for a few minutes. I was free for a few moments and that gave me hope for a future. 

Now, I'm happy to say that it's been a week and I'm not that obsessed anymore about what happened. I still have nightmares and thought about her, but not as toxic as they were.
Hopefully, it will continue, and I'll be able to free myself from depression. 

I'm now looking to reconnect with people I knew from high school and I'm ready to start a new chapter of my life. 

Thanks to everyone that tried to comfort me during that bad time, even if it didn't help per se, I really appreciated it.

"My friend (who is MtF transgender) is very very close to suicide and therapy nor meds don't seem to be helping.She's been suicidal since earlier this year when she (being polyamorous) had 3 of her relationships end simultaneously. Soon after that happened, quarantine began and she, being a person who thrives off frequent social interaction, started feeling worse and worse. 

Myself and her two exes kept talking with her and eventually, after pulling her from jumping, convinced her to seek therapy and medication. It's been hard for her to have consistent therapy because of quarantine and the therapists having tight schedules. She just started a new depression med called Mirtazipine a few weeks ago but that hasn't started helping yet.

She doesn't have a job or health insurance, and has really bad anxiety with dealing with customers, so getting a job that would work well is extremely difficult. She got fired from her last job from missing too many days because of depression. She ended up this month having to move into a boarding house with someone who turned out to be transphobic, and someone else there tested positive for Covid. Her only friend she had there also just tested positive so now she has to be locked away in her room with no physical interaction available.

She is being financially supported by her parents, but only until the end of the year. Her parents historically have been unsupportive of her being transgender, and generally don't help. They are very well off and wanted to invest in real estate that she could move into and pay rent for. They backed out of doing that right before she moved out of her old apartment, but her parents didn't tell her they backed out.

I, at this point and at my wit's end, have suggested that I talk with her parents because she doesn't feel it will help doing it herself. She told me not to mention suicide to her parents because she's worried they will call the police on her and place her on an involuntary hold. She had this done before and it only made everything worse because they treated her like garbage at the facility and she was feeling intense dysphoria without being able to shave at all, and she has terrible PTSD from that situation.

I mentioned that I would need to mention suicide so her parents know the severity of the situation, and she said that if the police are called, she'll flee with a knife and threaten to stab herself.

"I feel like killing myself and these past few months have been horrible (longish)(I'm sorry if the way I type is horrible, not exactly in a good state of mind)
so yeah this will possibly be long i don't even know right now.

okay, i'm in highschool young and everything. i should be some happy kid. not really so practically went to a doctor like two years ago and was clinically depressed been feeling the same since. When I got that home that day I got told by my older sister to 'get over it', my mother was on a vacation at the time and said she'd get me help never did she kinda just makes fake promises and then my dad has to step in although it's hard for just one parent and I know that.

Recently this year, everything has fallen down. At school a lot of the people I cared about left or it just broke apart. I sit in bathroom stalls and wait for breaks to be over and it's not the loneliness that bothers me it's the fact is I feel so just sad when I realize that I can't go outside without wanting to crawl in a hole and that I have no friends. Yes I've tried the good old solution of 'why not try and make friends' it's hard because I don't like the people in my school. Yes there maybe some different great side of them but I take into consideration what they decide to show and a lot of it is either disgusting or just nothing I'd ever relate with. Once upon a time I was more happy and courageous but ever since the start of this year I've lost motivation, I have potential in school but it's just the motivation to try and do it, it's not there. I've also recently grown to be very anxious and have social anxiety which impacts me a lot at school.

I've became more sad to the point I've began to self harm. It's not that I wanna cut deep enough and that I don't wanna stop. It's just the first cut kinda just... released something for me. Just made me feel like I am releasing inner demons but in the end it never worked and it's more like a vicious cycle. I don't know what I'm doing anymore and it's got to the point I will break down all the time and my anxiety is through the roof in real life. I feel like killing myself I'm just cowardly and scared to feel the pain.

I hate myself, I feel worthless and like I'm a burden everyday of my life. Even online I'm scared whenever no one replies and I freak out because I believe I've annoyed them and that I deserve it and then I hurt myself mentally even more. I have extreme self esteem issues and have recently thought about starving myself a week ago it got to the point where I was suffering severe dehydration and I didn't care. Almost once a year in the past 4 years I've been to hospital for dehydration leading to a virus. Each and everytime I've enjoyed the hospital, I find the hospital weirdly comforting and I just like laying in a bed and just sitting there not having to do anything. Most days when I wake up for school I just wanna stay in bed and think about just sleeping all day but I've already taken up to 3 months off these past 6 months. I plan to possibly starve myself because I feel like crap whenever I look at myself and my eating has gone down anyway. I've also always failed with friendships and each and everytime I do something wrong feel worthless and stupid and then I just accept I ruin every relationship/friendship and that I should just die.

Also I've had the big trouble of my mother doesn't support me. I remember the school social worker called my mum and I had no clue came home to hear 'Who's your friends at school?'. I told her no one and she just shrugged it off, she blames me for a lot of things when I ask simple things I just get yelled at. My sister is 23 and abuses me verbally, back two years ago when I was told by my G.P I was depressed and he gave me antidepressants. My mother never let me take them and at the moment my mother has been on holidays and my sister is 'caring' for me. I was at my dads on a Thursday night and I realized I don't have any charger or anything so I decided to leave Friday afternoon so i text my sister and ask kindly to leave the key under the door only to get told after awhile of me just being kind that ""I need to stop acting like an adult even though I'm young and that I treat everyone like shit. Also that I pulled the 'antidepressant thing'."" I've never thought of her as a sister either since we definitely don't love eachother in anyway. So it's always been a problem with no one to even lean on. ",suicidal,high

"i just want to die i can’t handle it no morei’m 16, but it feels like i’ve been through a life of a 70 year old depressed war veteran or something man. april (possibly this day idk) of last year, my ex girlfriend left me and left me to dread, she’s everything to me, she lives in tx and we were in a LDR, she would often play w my feelings and talk to other guys (often trying to cheat on me w my best friends who were like brothers to me,) and it hurts man, i miss her so much and she hates me, i had to delete all social media except twitter due to her having those social media’s and id see shit i never want to see.

i’m a fat coward, January of 2017 i decided to go homeschooling so i can pass my classes and not do summer school so i can see my girlfriend, i basically did it for nothing and from then to august (start of 2017-18 school year,) i gained 100 pounds, i burned many bridges do to me defending my ex, so much stuff, i miss being skinny and i don’t feel comfortable in my own skin and i just want to take diet pills or something bc i’m too unmotivated to work out man.

speaking of school, i completely fooled around freshman year resulting to me failing most of my classes, i did summer school but got expelled bc i accidentally burned a bathroom down (yes it was accidentally,) fighting a kid who claims to be a blood that i already had problems w, blamed it on him and got caught w weed and matches and such, so yeah i couldn’t make that up, sophomore year i was gone for a large amount of time due to me being in a mental hospital and recovering (i attempted suicide,) and i missed sm work, this year, i’m doing really good, i’ve only failed one course which ima make up. 

but i have a reputation at school unfortunately for being the “most likely to fuck up in life” person, everyone knows about me fucking up in school and life and i can’t graduate on time (i have to take an extra year) bc of how bad i did and it hurts bc i seem like a fucking loser and everyone’s gonna graduate and i won’t, everyone is also getting a job and having a license and car and i’m in a fucking freshman class for first period, it hurts knowing i’m the fuck up.

and about school, i have lots and lots of friends, i’m super popular, but everyone is pretty much just an acquaintance to me, but i also get a lot of shit for being myself, yeah, i’ll get to that in a bit, i dye my hair pink and cut my dickies on the bottoms above my ankles and all of a sudden i’m gay, i go from listening to nirvana to listening to chief keef, all of a sudden i’m a suicidal wigger emo, i just can’t be myself, people expect me to wear american eagle, true religions, jordan’s and supreme when i was wearing supreme in middle school and got shitted on for it, it bothers me so much.

my best friend who was like a brother to me, and my crew hate me now due to me crying to him on imessage about my ex and he just shits on me and i get mad at him, i start hanging w different ppl and he assumes i switched up on him when i just didn’t want to talk to him for a while bc i was so mad, i lost my brothers. he was all i had physically (my other best friends out of the “posse” are really far away,) and it hurts.

i make music and clothes but never released any of it bc whenever i share anything i get shitted on for it, and music and fashion are the two occupations i want to do for the rest of my life, i just feel like i’m going no where w it. 

i come home to the same shit everyday, just jacking off, checking twitter, listening to tyler the creator and lil peep, family fighting w family, just so depressing, EVERY FUCKING DAY,

i’m scared for the summer to come bc last summer was when i was at my loneliest do to me burning bridges and losing my ex, i don’t want to be alone again, there’s nothing to do in the summer time.

society also makes me want to leave this planet bc, like i said, everyone is a sheep, everyone wants to act like each other listening to the same music that’s trending, wearing the same fucking clothes they get at their local zumiez and if you don’t follow them rules, you’re weird unfortunately, i just wish everyone can just be themselves, another thing is, im italian so i’m considered white by society which i agree w, everyone decides to shit on white people and everyone acts like every white person is racist, a school shooter, a serial killer, anything that’s bad and we get blamed on for everything but i’m none of those things, idk it just bothers me i feel like i’m hated by everyone.

i have a therapist and on medication, it doesn’t do shit to me, it helps when we talk but after that, i’m back to shit, i cant do this no more man

i miss my ex i miss my best friends i miss being happy i miss being skinny i miss not being a fuck up i miss the old me 

i can’t do this no more, please,

"Wish I could cease to exist.Here is an in depth article on my personal experience of depression and anxiety and how it came to be - [here.](https://kayderella.co.uk/2017/08/11/dread/)

tl;dr - I started with panic attacks due to phobia of vomiting, it escalated to general anxiety and OCD, then had my son which caused post-natal depression on top of the other mental health issues.

I feel like recently it is one bad thing after another and I can't seem to pick myself up. I made the decision to hand over primary care of my son to my Mum come January so he could attend nursery and be a little more normal but my friends have expressed great distaste for this and think it best he remains under my care.


I have had three mental break downs in as many weeks and considered suicide but have always stopped myself because I can't imagine someone having to explain to my three year old why he would never see me again. This breaks my heart to write but I just want him to be happy and I can't help but feel I will some how mess him up.


I just feel like I'm not enough for him. I barely get by and because of my anxiety and depression I don't have great prospects for work. I'd like to work from home but I don't have any talents that stand out or I can afford to work on.
Every time I speak with friends or my Mum it comes across as though I'll somehow be cured and things will go back to normal but I can't see myself ever being normal again. I can't imagine not living in fear of germs.

"Why bother...This will be the 2nd time I've brought up my thoughts of suicide anonymously... First time was on Omegle probably a week ago, now I'm posting here.

I've had the urge to kill myself for much longer, obviously, and it's just been this past week where it's almost getting too much to handle. Normally, I can just tell myself no, I'm not going to do it, but it's getting harder and harder.

My depression has been getting worse too. Lately I've been sleeping for more than 12 hours a day and eating maybe once a day. I've had problems caring about handing in projects for my classes, or even going to classes. Two weeks ago I just stayed home for the week. I told everyone that I was sick, but I guess that wasn't really a lie. 

My struggle with depression probably started in grade 8 or 9. The friends I was hanging out with before all went to gangs and were just general shitheads. I realized that, and moved away from them. But I didn't really make friends again until I was in grade 12 (for the 2nd time). After our first semester in university though, I started drifting away from them. Right now I can only call 4 people friends. Although, I never see them. I never see anyone. Almost every waking moment I have I spend it in front of the computer, because there's nothing else to do.

I've tried talking to therapists, I've tried taking antidepressants (Wellbutrin), and I've tried smoking pot hoping it would just make me happy. It didn't, nothing really has.

I'm not sure what I'm doing telling everyone here this, but I figure I'll try anything right now.",suicidal,high

"My girlfriend is suicidal. Help!My gf of about a month (I've known her for years) recently told me that she is depressed and has already been through 2 attempts to end it all. I love her very much and I want to help however I can but she is extremely pessimistic about the future and I simply can't propose an argument to why she shouldn't be. This situation is tearing me apart because I have anxiety and my brain always thinks of the worst case scenario when things don't go smoothly.

Today we found out that her favorite band canceled their visit to our country but they would show up sometime later this year for sure. I told her it's OK, they'll be coming again so when that time comes we'll go together. She started saying things like ""who knows what's gonna happen until then"" which made me worry too much. So I asked what could possibly happen, but she wouldn't give a straight answer. I then brought up that I'm worried and that resulted in her saying ""I'm not going to say anything ever again. I shouldn't have opened up that day at all and I don't want to open up anymore. You already know too much.""

How am I supposed to handle this? The whole thing is eating away at me slowly and all I want is her well-being. It should also be noted that we are about 2 hours away by car, which makes things even more difficult because neither of us has a car. ",suicidal,high

"How to stay happy?I have posted on here several times before. Each time, I have been talked out of killing myself. However, I am tired of being talked out of it. I want to either stop being miserable, or just die. I recently quit my job at McDonalds because it was making me more suicidal than ever and have been going to college. I am scared of my horrible grades, as I think I may go on academic probation. After that, I will have large student loans pilled up on my head, no job, and no way to ever get a job that isn't a dead end job that makes me want to kill myself. Therefore, I have decided if I go on probation, I'll kill myself. I have gotten obsessed with the idea of death lately. I think about what death would be like and ways I could quickly die about 70% of the day. What is bothersome to me, is that other people who have the same situation, or even worse situations, are able to stay happy. This is frustrating to me, not because these people are happy, but because I feel like I am completely missing something that these people are. Is it genetic? Is it a mindset? If it is either, how could we ever change our mindsets or genetics, after all, we are who we are.



TL;DR I am extraordinarily unhappy because of many situations, and am likely going to kill myself at the end of the semester unless I can find a way to stay happy. I am tired of being talked out of it, this is a final decision. Instead, I want advice to be happy.",suicidal,high

"Killing myself Sunday nightI don't really want to, but it's the only way.

A year ago I had been recovering from anorexia, which I did successfully I may add. Reached a healthy stable weight. Worked through all my behaviors, and most of the thoughts.

However, around that time I started to get sick. It's a long story, but at this point I'm essentially crippled. There's so much wrong with my body, and everyday fucking day is hell. 

And yet, I could maybe live with shitty health. Unfortunately, my endocrine system has been really wrecked. There's no treatment (as most of my hormone levels are in normal range, even though I have a ton of hard, physically evident symptoms), one of which is rampant weight gain.

In 8 months I've gain 60 lbs, 20 in the past month. Literally nothing I do helps. Two dieticians are confounded as to what's going on. Because of the nature of my condition, it's not going away any time soon.

I'm losing my mind because of how fat I've gotten, and I'm only getting fatter. Body image is the one thing I didn't fully work through, because I was able to accept my healthy weight, but this...I'm too fat. I have to die.

I know it sounds crazy. It's the most asinine thing, killing myself because I'm fat. But I can't live with myself like this. Therapy has stopped working. Don't suggest meds.

I bought a gun, will clean the house and pack my stuff, then unless something happens, I'm doing it. I can't live with being fat.",suicidal,high

"My Roommate is Not OkayHey yall,

I am writing this because I am seriously concerned with the welfare of my roommate. Last night she attempted suicide while myself and my other roommates were in class. Some of our friends got to our house in time to talk to her. They ended up making her call a campus hotline (she was refusing), she went to sleep, and then the hotline called back and sent a police welfare check who took her to the hospital. She was lying to the people on the hotline, and I think she was lying to whatever psychologist she talked to at the hospital because she was there and back in under three hours. The way her mental health has been for the last year, they probably should have kept her there longer.

I've been her roommate for two years. She's self harmed, abused narcotics and other drugs to cope, and for a while was displaying traits of alcoholism. She started seeing a psychiatrist over the summer, but her meds are giving her side effects and she wont tell the psych about them. As soon as she got back to school, she went immediately back to how she was the previous year. She is refusing help from all of her friends at school, and lies to her family about what's really going on. She was going to take a year off from school, but then decided not to because her mom convinced her it would be harder if she came back a year later and was in a different grade than her friends.

I have no idea what to do. Everyone keeps telling me that all of this is her decision, but it was also her decision to put herself consistently in harm's way, so I do not trust her to make her own decisions right now. I'm also concerned for the health of myself and my other roommates: my two other roommates have never dealt with this before and cannot cope with it, and I have severe depression and this is triggering for me. It's not just that I don't want her to be in this kind of pain, but I also cannot live around it like I did last year (I know this sounds selfish, but I really just can't). I'm angry that people keep telling me I can't do anything to make her actually get help and take it seriously.

"Sometimes I feel like I want to die (not really urgent but please help nonetheless)This is my first actual post here, I've recently discovered this subreddit and have been lurking a bit, commenting here and there a few times.

Sometimes the thought of suicide crosses my mind, I kinda want to but at the same time don't really want to, does that make sense? It's like, not wanting to die because you recognize the blessings you've been given, but instead just wish your parents never gave birth to you in the first place.

I have social anxiety due to bullying, I've made friends but sometimes I grow distant because I feel like they're just talking to me out of pity, or that I'm just a hassle or burden in their life whenever I try to talk to them, like I'm just some waste of time. I know this sounds somewhat selfish in a way, knowing that there are tons of people who have it way worse than I do, but I do believe there is genuinely something wrong with me and I need advice on how to cope with all of this, sometimes I just isolate myself completely from my friends, thinking they all probably hate me.

"What does it mean to be suicidal?It has recently come to my attention that a lot of people lurk here who are not suicidal. So I thought it might help to explain something. 

I think people who have never been suicidal don't understand what it means. They get the impression that a suicidal person is just very sad or upset, but it's way deeper than that. Sure, sometimes people get sad and have ""thoughts of suicide"", that's normal and probably happens to (and I don't use this word lightly) literally everyone. 

But to actually be chronically suicidal is different; it's the symptom of several diseases. The primary function of the human brain is self preservation, so taking that into consideration chronic suicidal ideation is organ failure of the brain. It convinces you that it's for the best, that you are actually doing harm to the people and things you care about by NOT killing yourself. That's not just a fleeting idea, you believe it, it is obvious to you the same way the sky is blue. And the physical sensations are excruciating. Your mind feels like it's on fire, not in a metaphorical way. 

That's why we don't want to hear your empty words about how we're great or it gets better. That has no meaning to a person suffering in that way. The words mean nothing, it's just gibberish. We don't need words, we need medicine, the same way someone in kidney failure needs dialysis. So if you really want to help make changes to the healthcare system and ask how people are doing BEFORE they're suicidal and cannot hear you.",suicidal,high

"Umm so yeahIdk what I'm doing tbh, I'm not gonna kill myself I just wanted a place to talk about suicide.

I want to die. Like genuinely. I don't want to get better, I don't want the other side, I want to be dead. But I don't wanna regret it yknow? It seems so fuckin perfect. Like I can't fuck up once I'm dead. Nobody has to put up with me once I'm dead. I can't keep hurting people once I'm dead. Like, it's peaceful. Better for everyone in the long run.

I find myself pushing everyone away, thinking that they'll eventually stop caring, but instead I end up hurting them. Ideally, everyone would just stop giving a shit, then id have no guilt. I think about ways I could go, but I don't want to effect anyone that finds my body. I live near a train track, perhaps that would be good? It'll fuck me up so bad maybe they won't even realise I was a person. Although I usually think I'd drink a shit tonne, then od on something. Haven't quite figured out what. I take comfort in knowing that suicide is always an option. I could choose to make everything better, but instead I insist on punishing myself and those around me. I can't decide if I'm worthy of the escape, tbh. Like, I'm a shitty person so maybe I deserve to suffer by being alive. Or perhaps life is so good that I don't deserve to be alive. It often feels like every good thing in my life I turn into a way to hurt myself. I am a toxic person, I do not understand why people still care. Make it stop... God please make it stop. I've even turned therapy into a way to emotionally abuse myself. I was supposed to get meds, but im 15 so they won't prescribe any. At this point I'm sick of trying. I'm so fucking tired of not getting better. I'm so fucking sick of living. Nothing feels worth it. We're all gonna die one day anyway? I suppose the dilemma comes down to whether or not I think life is a blessing, and I guess that's a difficult question to answer for anybody, not just someone who wants to die.  

It doesn't hurt me to know that the world would be better without me in it. In fact, only a tiny fraction of the population would know. This is why I don't like people telling me the world is better with me in it. Its not, I know it's not. I'm fine with that. Say I continue to live and it wasn't worth it? I've just wasted peoples time, their effort. Its not going to be worth it.

There's truly very little I care about. And I certainly don't care about myself. Sure I want everyone to be okay, like I don't want anything bad to happen to anyone, but I don't care enough to sit and listen to people or help them? Like, if I car was going to hit someone, I'd switch places. Perhaps not to save them, but more to kill myself, but I don't exactly want them to die either. I suppose it's just easier to go out in a horrific accident than have suicide attached to my name forever, maybe more dignified?

All I really wanted was peace, and I can't have that because everything is blurry and loud. I'm void of any coping at it feels like it will kill me.

I guess I'm not sure the point in writing this, I don't want pity, I'm not sure anything anybody says is gonna change it, yknow? Such as life. I think I'm just gathering my thoughts. I don't know how to not feel like this. Its getting more difficult to do anything, and in all honesty, I don't know how much longer before it kills me. In afraid I don't know what that means. The only thing I'm really sure of is that I can't be here. I don't really know. I need a break but I don't think any amount of time will ever be long enough.",suicidal,high
"Guys, I'm not sure what to do...I just got left by my girlfriend of almost 2 years.  I had devoted myself to the relationship, and our mutual happiness.  I learned so much about myself, and about her, and i thought we were on the right track.  I was easily within the ""Pop the question"" time frame. Obviously she wasn't.  She gave me a few reasons like ""I need time and space to figure out who I am and who I'm becoming."" &amp; ""I feel like i've lost myself in this relationship.""  I thought I always celebrated the things that made her unique, and now, I'm alone. After this long and this much dedication, I realize that I wanted no one but her for the rest of my life, and also that I can't really function without her.  Lingering thoughts about the quickest, least painful, and least messy ways to finish myself off grow more and more present. I just had to tell someone.",suicidal,high

"Ok females and males alike listen There is a difference between preferences and requirements in partners. For example if someone turns you down due to you being short than they require you to be tall which is the asshole female meanwhile a guy turning down a girl due to weight is them being a asshole as well. But those are both requirements for them. Now I have preferences and requirements too and everyone does like it or not. 

My requirements include.
Female (I’m straight)
Have good origins (don’t have thug roots and/or be a thug)
And acceptant of the fact that I’m overweight and like me back.

Now I have many preferences and many my current gf doesn’t meet (although she is perfect in every way)

Shorter than me (my current one is 5’8’ and I’m 5’5’)
Gamer (current one not gamer)

So my point is just because a girl likes y’all guys doesn’t mean she won’t like you and just because a guy likes thicc or skinny girls doesn’t mean you don’t have a shot I mean I’m 210 lbs and my gf said she said she preferred skinnier guys when we were just talking so just believe personality beats looks by about 4 times",normal,low

I want to die, but it's either going to hurt me, and others no matter how I go about it. So I'll just wait it out, since that's what everyone feels I should do.

I want to die in a comfy armchair sipping something nice, and with Doctor Who playing in the background. I want to feel really tired and doze off to never wake up again.

I lost my father at age 11, in March, and nothing has been the same since. His passing isn’t the main thing that makes me want to die, I’m just constantly sad for no reason and I just feel like such a waste of space. I always cry and I’m such a pathetic child. I’m extremely self conscious and I’ll never think of myself as anything better than a waste of space. I come from a decently large family, and me being the youngest child doesn’t help as I’ve always been just kinda picked on I guess.

I self-harm, very often and it’s always in large amounts. All up both of my arms (from my wrists to my shoulders) are covered with cuts. I try to talk to my best friend about my cuts but he’s so accepting and he doesn’t see anything wrong with it. Personally I think of all my cuts and scars as so beautiful.

I just want to end my life, i know everyone says “Oh, you’re so young! You have so much left to still discover!”. I’m always complimented on my level of maturity and I know I’m very mature for your average Irish teenager. I know I want to end my life, but I’m still unsure on how to do it.

i have been putting dying off for weeks. the holidays, work, things that i knew i needed to do. but i know that i can do it any time, and i have enough pills to do it, and they are constantly taunting me from my medicine cabinet. i feel like simultaneously a coward and a burden, like i will destroy the people around me if i go through with suicide and like i will make their lives worse if i stay.

I love a man who is the greatest man I've ever met. He makes me happy in a way of what I think happiness is. I can't really feel anymore. I have attempted suicide twice and failed both times. I've been hospitalized for depression twice and had no prevail. 
 I feel as if I've ruined my life because I am constantly going to be battling this addiction it's like a parasite sucking the life right out of me. I will never be able to enjoy things I once did because all I can think about is getting my dope. I am to the point now where I just want to end it all because I don't feel like fighting my addiction is worth it anymore. I just want to watch the crimson blood flow down my arms. 
I've ruined relationships with my family and friends that can never be replaced and I'm lost. I'm wondering around life motionless. I work hard for my money and get paid then 5 minutes later its gone up my nose.
I feel like there is no point to get clean because it will always be in the back of my head waiting whispering "" it's okay, you can do it just once"" but I can't do it just once. 
My boyfriend is the only thing keeping me from putting the knife to the skin, but I feel like I'm letting him down too. I have never loved a man so deeply as I do him but I feel as if I'm in two relationships one with him and one with my addiction as well. I am exhausted from hiding and battling every day. I need to escape and ending it all seems as the only outlet now. ",suicidal,high
"I think I’m in a toxic friendship So basically I’ve been friends with this girl since year 7, and now I’m in year 10. And there are so many things that I am noticing now that make me think that it may actually be a toxic relationship, and especially when I look back on past events. 

Like i remember last year I got 90% on my chemistry test and I was so happy so I told her and she said ‘well I got 95%, no wonder I’m the smart one in the friend group’. That comment really hurt me, and I don’t know why I didn’t notice anything then, but stuff like this happens all the time relating to school work. I was sad that I no longer got to sit next to her in a lesson and she simply said it’s because ‘I mess around too much’, yet she’s the one who distracts me, or like I’ve told her about how I have trouble focusing on homework and in lessons and she said it’s ‘because I’m lazy’ and that it’s ‘no wonder that I don’t do as well as her’. And also then in German, where basically I know the teacher is basing all her hatred for me based of me not doing well in one test in September, she says that i ‘definitely need to go to German help’, even tho I’m actually doing quite well now. 

It’s not just with academics. It’s also just she likes to put me down all the time it feels like. Like I sit next to her in biology, but she will ignore me the entire time and instead talk to the person sitting on the other side of her and play game with the and I just feel so left out. I mean I’d understand if she’d want to focus on her work, but no she’s to busy talking to someone else, and doesn’t care about me. I’m also a fairly short guy, and she likes to make fun of me all the time about it. I’ve even told her that I don’t like it, cause I’m insecure about it, yet she will still make fun of me and it really does hurt me. 

Also, I came out to her as gay, and her response was ‘uh me to. Your not special just cause your gay. Get over it’ 

She also loves to ignore me. Like I’ll text her and she will leave me on read for an entire week. Also she plays these really cruel jokes on me.  Like in year 8 I had this huge crush on Tom Holland, and she pulled this ‘prank’ on me where she claimed to be family friends with Tom Holland, and then said that he died in a car crash and I actually believed her and was very sad. 

Also in regards to my mental health, I told her about how I was struggling with depression and anxiety. Her response was ‘me too. Mine is worse that yours cause I’ve been struggling with it since I was 5. You just don’t know because im so good at hiding it. Also don’t tell anyone else about how your problems’ I was speechless at that response, like it doesn’t have to be a fricking competition. This happened a few days ago and was kinda what made me notice everything. 

Sorry if this was just kinda all over the place, I just needed to get it out of my system",normal,low

"My mind works in strange ways.It's hard to put into words how I feel. That's mainly because it's a complicated situation. All I know for sure is that my mind doesn't work right. It can't even tell whether or not it wants to go on and live, or just shut off and die, all quiet like. Maybe it wants to scream and bleed until it unmakes something critical and falls apart. It already feels like the unraveling noose in my drawer. Hell, last night I fluctuated between crying, laughing, crying and laughing, screaming, gagging, spitting and drooling, and pummeling my head. It hurts though. My meds aren't helping. My therapy is honestly laughable. I know I need to think more positively; that's why I'm IN therapy. I can't tell whether or not it's the unrequited love that broke me, if it's the isolation, the lack of purpose or achievement, or what, but I'm broken. Some part of me died long ago, the part that could be happy. Now, all that's left are the festering remains of his corpse; the physical remains decaying in the playground, waiting to scare kids into a life of PTSD and sleepless nights. My emotions are the worst. I can't trust myself; I'm a man with ulterior motives, hidden to the world, yes, but also to himself. That's a fundamental truth. I feel wrong in everything I do, isolated and wrong. Evil is one way to describe it, but broken is better. I can't trust myself on just about anything. All I know is that I love someone, but the situation means that won't work. And maybe for the better. Myself cannot and will not be made happy by Myself, so how could I even dream of making her happy? I can't. I won't. I need to be a little braver, just need a little ounce, a speck, of bravery, and I can make her situation so much easier. I can remove what makes the situation complicated for her. I can remove myself; I've already served my purpose to her. I've given her a book, I've given her a place to stay when her situation gets dire. That's all she needs from me, and hopefully all she wants. I still have her hairpin though; she left it here when she crashed at my place. It's long, thin, and black. I could make a joke there, but I won't. Anyways, if I do end up mustering the courage and killing myself, I want that returned to her. Maybe my family or some investigative authority will find my post and read it, and give it back to her. That's all I can hope for.

Anyways, I'm gonna quit my tirade now. If someone does find this, or if she reads it herself, make sure she knows I hope she enjoys the book I gave her. It's a good read. A bit long winded, but it's a whole lotta fun. If you wanna read it, it's called Blood Meridian. It's about a teenage boy named The Kid who joins a band of scalp hunters in the Texas-Mexico territory. They progressively descend into degeneracy and violence, and are led by a violent man named Glanton and the enigmatic, shadowy figure only known as The Judge. Check it out if you like westerns, or like a really violent, gruesome read.",suicidal,high

"I'm not sure how much more disappointment I can take.I've been unemployed for just over six months and I am on my last week of benefits. I was fired from an abusive, confusing and stressful job that I ultimately hated, despite always putting in serious effort and insane hours. Since then, it has been difficult to find a job at my level, or even below my level due to my lack of a bachelor's degree and the fact that I was terminated from my previous position. 

My good name was tarnished at my previous job by one of my subordinates who manipulated several situations with my bosses to get me fired and gaslighted me the entire time we worked together. That person then took my position at the company. That person has since been fired for trying to do the same thing with other employees, but the damage has been done to me. 

A car that I am financing and paying a high amount for insurance is unreliable and has some sort of electrical issue I can't afford to even have evaluated, let alone fixed. My other vehicle is so old and rare that parts can't even be found for it anymore, so I'm just waiting for the day that it decides to call it quits on me.

I've been applying for lower-level receptionist positions in the same field, but still getting picked over. Mind you, I've hired people for these kinds of positions in this small town, and that's the most insulting part. I know the types of people that apply for these positions, most of them can't spell. I guess you could say that I feel like I'm better than this, and mostly better than the competition. I know that sounds elitist, entitled and unprofessional. I have never said anything like this out loud and would never admit to it outside a throwaway account. It's toxic and it's not how I present myself ever. That's just what the last few months have done to me.

My spouse is older than me and I went into this marriage several years ago with full knowledge of his health conditions. Unfortunately, things have taken several negative turns in the last few months and I'm currently trying to get him an appointment in the city, since there is no one here to adequately treat him. That's about 160mi round trip, which means gas I have to pay for and excessive wear on my vehicle. 

I very recently started applying for part time work at hotels (front desk, custodial, etc...) and can't get an interview until the beginning of next month, by which time I'll be broke.

My dad is pretty useless and ruined my mom's credit when I was a child. So building/protecting my credit has been paramount. I've still never missed any payments, but my score has dropped into the 500s since I have only been making minimum payments and allowed some balances to grow. My overall debt isn't that bad (\~$12,000), but it is suffocating me right now and I can't fathom going delinquent on anything. I have two cards that I'm late on already and I'm not sure how I'm gonna handle that. I don't want to be a loser. 

It seems really silly for me to care so much about my debt, but I've spent my life always doing the right thing. Everything just seems so unfair to me right now and if that isn't bad enough, my cynical, entitled thoughts are making it worse. 

I can start off in a good mood, but even the most minor of inconveniences and disappointments can send me into a downward spiral of hopelessness. I don't want to die, I guess. I just want to stop existing.",suicidal,high

"I thought medication and counselling would help me to get rid off intense social anxiety but still have got not even 1% benefit from it. I still want to die/disappear because of social anxiety. Social anxiety made my life hell for me. I really don't know what to do next.Because of social anxiety i went into depression and attempted suicide which was failed. When parents tried to know the reason of suicide i told parents that i have been suffering from social anxiety which made me difficult survive into corporate world like doing job, attending interviews and so many such issues and problems explained to them. 

	Luckily parents understand that i have some serious mental health issues and we altogether decided	to get mental health treatment though it was out of my budget.

	I don't have any other skill or talent through which i can earn money without socializing. For me as well as for family my salary is the only source of income. 

	In fact after some sessions of medications and counselling realized that no miracle is going to happen. I myself have to get rid off mental health issued and that is totally impossible for me as i am really really coward, anxious, hopeless, with zero energy, no will to overcome social anxiety and tired with all this.

I thing there is nothing wrong in excepting fact that not everyone is born to survive into this world. Many peoples life has been destroyed because of serious mental health issues. So I think i am already destined to kill myself.

I don’t ever talk about my feelings or what I’m going through because generally I am robotic and feel nothing and can handle everything.

I don’t know why I’m typing this out but I guess it’s a step.

I’ve tried pills, and ended up forcing myself to puke.
I’ve tried cutting and ended up bandaging myself back up well enough to not die.
I’ve thought of hanging myself, jumping off of something. Running into traffic. Poison. Everything.

I’ve gotten my hands on lots of things.

But I just can’t do it.

"Chronically ill. Suicidal.Sorry this is kind of long. I just have a lot to say and nobody in real life will listen. 

I’m chronically ill with, what my doctors call, a severe case of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome. All of my joints dislocate on a daily basis, sitting too long will cause fabrics to rip into my skin, standing up makes me blackout instantly and I hit my head regularly because of this, I can no longer walk and use a wheelchair to get around, I have a problem with literally all of my organs from this, and I’m constantly in pain. There is no cure for this shitty disease I was born with. As of this year, I can’t drive anymore without vomiting or falling asleep. 

Since it’s gotten worse this past year, I’ve been struggling in school. Since I have accommodations through my university’s Accessibility Resources, I have excused medical absences and no late penalty for assignments. However, all of my professors tell me to drop out since I haven’t been able to attend the last two weeks. Even before I got worse recently, they always keep trying to ask “what’s wrong with me” and I’m not comfortable sharing that with them and it’s incredibly awkward. Additionally, they’d always call me out in class and say shit like “I know this makes you uncomfortable, [name],” or “Would this work for you? I know you can’t walk.” I don’t know if they’re actually trying to be helpful but they make me feel singled out in front of 30+ people. One professor even keeps trying to meet me outside of class to talk about my “medical issues.” Accessibility Resources is in the midst of dealing with all of those problems, since I can’t deal with this anymore myself but it’s going nowhere. 

I’ve been diagnosed with Major Depressive disorder with psychotic features. Another doctor says I’m probably autistic on top of that but I can’t afford testing, since my insurance generally only covers 1% for procedures. They covered $17 of my brother’s $15k sleep study. I see psychiatrists, therapists, rheumatologist, occupational and physical therapists, cardiologists, gastroenterologist, a connective tissue clinic, and neurologists. I’ve been seeing these people, from three different hospitals, for years now. I’m just not getting better. 

I’m going to have to drop out of college since I can’t get to my classes or do any of the work. I have to quit my job because I can’t get to work. However, this job is waiting to fully hire me (with benefits and better health insurance) when I get my degree, since I’m two semesters away from graduating. But I’m throwing that all away since I literally can’t leave my bed. 

I’ve always been suicidal since I was ten and was constantly in and out of psych inpatient units. Since 2010, I’ve tried to kill myself 20 times. The last time I was in an inpatient unit (last year), one of the male nurses pressed his erection into my back, and I can barely go into hospitals anymore because I’m just terrified of male doctors and nurses now. 

I’m on ten different medications for a myriad of reasons and none work as intended. 

I don’t have any friends, at work or from school, so I don’t have anyone to talk to or get help from. I lost all of my friends within the last year because they’re “tired of being friends with someone as disabled as [me].” 

Last time I called 911 for assistance, they tried to put me in an inpatient unit, but chose not to after explaining what happened last time and that I’m actively seeing doctors on a weekly basis. 

I’m at a loss and feel permanently stuck. 

When I drop out, I’ll lose all of my scholarships and grants and won’t be able to even do part time. So college is pretty much over for me, even though it was my favorite thing to do. 

I don’t plan on living much longer. I’m done. I can’t live like this anymore. I’m so emotionally, physically, and academically exhausted. I’m truly not meant to live normally in this world and I’m tired of trying. I haven’t left my bed in days and don’t have energy to eat or drink. 

Thanks for reading this, if you did. Nobody bothers listening to me in real life, so I guess it’s nice posting how I feel here. 

TL;DR: Can’t do anything because of physical illnesses, probably going to kill myself soon.",suicidal,high

6. Witty. I have to say the right things at the right time every time. I have to talk in the right tone. I have to be funny. I can't blurt shit out. I can't talk in the most natural way for me. I have to constantly monitor everything I say or do. Who wants to be with somebody obnoxious?
5. Trendy. I have to like what everyone else likes. I have to watch the latest tv shows or movies. Who wants to be with someone out of touch?
6. The Best. I have to prove my worth. I have to be better than my peers. Mediocrity is not an option. Who settles for losers?

I can't be me. And I'm so tired of doing anything without ever having anyone to share it with. Its so pointless and empty.

"The end of the roadI've never posted on reddit to be frank. My girlfriend suggested I do. So here I am, at the end of the road, with no clue what I'm supposed to do. I've had Robles with depression for about 11 years now, but in recent times I think about ending it everyday. At the very least I visualize slicing open my arm, the depth of it, the blood gushing out. It's always there.

I live in a developing country with no social security or really any kind of support system in place for pretty much anything. I am so heavily in debt that I don't even have the strength to find out just how much. I recently gave interviews and even managed to get a job which I can't take. I was hoping that job would help me with my debts, help me get back on my feet. I'm so broke right now that my checking account is in negative and I had to walk back 10k from my interview and sleep hungry because I have no money. On top of it all, I'm meant to support my brother and I can barely give him enough to feed himself, let alone give him enough to attend college. I'm fucking up his life because I fucked up mine.

My mom who stays in another country has an apartment she'd like to sell which is currently resided by her mother and sister-in-law (SIL) who are absolutely horrible to her and won't leave. As I mentioned, not a lot of support systems where I am and courts are backlogged. My whole family is in a financial rut so my mum can't come down and fight a legal battle to get possession of her own house which she'd like to sell for some financial support.

I'm made POA and am supposed to fight the case. How I'm supposed to pay the lawyers I don't know. I'm scared my mums SIL, who is known to have crooked friends will do something to me to disrupt court proceedings. On top of that I get calls from creditors every single day. With no laws governing what they can do, they are Hella abusive and threatening. Soon they'll be making visits to my house. Even if I do manage to get a job while fighting the case in court. I'm so far behind on payments that my creditors will be making visits to my workplace if I get a job (they really have no boundaries or laws governing them). If that leads to termination, I can kiss getting another job goodbye.

Thought about filing for bankruptcy to get some breathing room but even that'd require me hiring a lawyer which I cannot afford and trips to court. My girlfriend has helped me financially as much as she can. She still helps me out with meals every now and again, even used her car to go for interviews. But now I have to move to another city because the legal case is there. I'm scared of leaving behind the one person who has been my support through it all. Sometimes I feel like she deserves much better than me. My brain convinces me that she's pulling away when it's me who is pushing her away when all she's doing is trying to help.

I really don't know what I can do right now to get myself out of this. I can't take more of my creditors, and listening to how poorly my mum is treated is by her own mother. My grandmum told her she's a bitch and deserves to lie in dirt. This broke her and it broke me. I don't even think I'm in a frame of mind where I'd be able to work even if I got a job.

I don't even know what I'm looking for here. Maybe I just need to vent and my girlfriend suggested this is a good medium to do so.",suicidal,high

"The only reason I am alive is because I owe too much...To my parents. They've spent their entire life trying extremely hard to help me in every way, but I've come to think it's just not possible for me to pay them back no matter what I do. If I knew my death wouldn't devastate them I would be hanging right now. I know how to tie two knots like the back of my hands: my shoelaces and a goddamn noose.

But I'm too rational a person to mill myself. And I owe too much to kill myself. And I'll go to hell if I kill myself. But every day I can feel I am slipping a little closer. I'm getting a little less sane, a little less smart, and a little less rational every day. 

I have tried being open about it. Nobody knows how to help me, and I ended up feeling worse for upsetting them. As for a therapist? I had one. She was really helpful, but the first antidepressants had me feeling apathetic, so she switched me to a different medication that ended up making me suicidal (even more than I am now). I was going to swallow all of the pills I could find, but I barely stopped myself and messaged her and my family. The result: she abandoned me because she didn't want to take responsibility. 

I am sitting here with a noose I tied. I don't have anywhere private and strong enough to hang it, and perhaps not enough intent to hang myself. But as it's going, I am getting closer and closer. I just want it to be quick, painless, and clean; these three things are the only things stopping me when I have a seriously bad episode. 

I know I sound incoherent. I said I have only one reason but I don't even know anymore. All I know is that when it comes down to it, there's just a tiny fine line stopping me when it gets bad. And every time it gets bad that line gets tinier and finer. I don't know when it will snap. But if this doesn't stop, it snapping is guaranteed. ",suicidal,high

I can't eat. I can't sleep. I can't do work.

Everything I do is riddled with so much anxiety that I can't do anything.

I live in an endless cycle of hell. And I'm tired of it. I really am.

My room's a mess, I don't even have a bed at the moment so I alternate between sleeping in my mom's room and on the sofa. 

I can go the whole week without showering, which is gross, but I literally don't have the time, and I don't care about anything. I am severely depressed. More than people think I am. I don't care about anything and I don't want to do anything.

I look at other people my age and they have jobs, relationships, they go out, learning how to drive and I can't do anything.

I can't even go in to school without breaking down and crying. I'm so sad all the time. I'm on meds, been on them for at least a month, but my life is just a wreck. More than I can even explain on here.

And I don't want to do it anymore. I don't want to be me anymore.

I don't think I'm gonna make it to my birthday in 2 months, much less the year. 

I have a therapist that I only see once a week but it's not enough.

I can't cope with life. I don't want to cope with life.

I just want to die, because being alive is so painful.

 I look back at pictures of me when I was younger and it makes me so sad. I was always happy, wanted to be centre of attention, always smiling for the camera; whereas of someone tried to take a picture of me now I'd try to burn their phone, and I can't remember the last time I was generally happy.

""You're so young""

That's what makes it worse.

I'm so young, yet have felt enough heartache to last me a lifetime. I'm so stressed I'm getting multiple rashes all over my skin..

"Living my dream to how I fucked up my lifeI can't believe how different my life is now compared to a year and a half ago...
I was studying at uni, doing an internship with a film company I loved, had gotten accepted into a dance team and was training for gigs/competitions

I guess I fucked it all up when I started counselling near the end of my degree, when I started to confront my feelings of gender disphoria. During my counselling I realised I wanted so badly to transition, to tell my loved ones and to feel accepted and I was ready to.

Then it all went down hill... I graduated after getting a month extension and because of that I wasn't able to graduate with my friends.

My dance crew took a break so I stopped dancing and isolated myself in my room and continued binge eating (which I always turn to when trying to finish uni deadlines). I worked a part time job and on my free time I  would just watch shows on my phone and spend my wage on food.

after a couple months I'd put on 15 kilos and had completely given up on following my passions in dance and my Film/VFX degree and go make it worse the weight made me look so much more feminine.

fast forward to now I just got laid off my full time night shift job, I've put on another 15 kg and given up on hopes of ever trasitioning or doing anything with my life. I just want to find another mindless night-shift job to make ends meet untill I've properly planned out my suicide and worked up the guts.",suicidal,high

"I am completely apathetic and can't feel anything.. I see no fricking point in continuing on living.It has gotten extremely hard to deal with. Each day that passes i feel worse. I have been going to a therapist and have been on meds for a few months. They say that the meds should kick in and start working for me but I need to be patient. I have tried three and feel like it will never work. 
I honestly have no interest in the world at all whatsover. I don't even know how to explain this. I literally want nothing to do with it and do not want to take a part in life. I have nothing that I want to do or go out and accomplish. Every ounce of motivation that I may have somehow mustered up at one point is vanquished by the darkness. I feel nothing. I don't know if I want to die necessarily but I know that if the choice was put in front of me to continue living or to cease to exist entirely.... I would go with no existence. 
It sounds terrible because it is terrible. I know that there are many others who feel the way that I do and that are in very deep depressions. I just feel like I am completely disconnected from everything and that I shouldn't even bother seeking help because in the long run it won't help me. Despite the fact that I am able to get some things off my chest when I talk to a therapist, I have reaped no other benefits from going and doing so. 
I guess... I am writing this today because I truly am a lost person. I don't function like a normal person should and everything that I do seems slow and tedious. I have no energy to do anything and my apathy is intense. I feel nothing at all. When I fight with someone.... I feel nothing... When I see a sad movie... the tears stream but it's like I am completely dissociated from those tears. Like it's not me crying them.... When my nephew was born I didn't feel the happiness that everyone around me felt. I can let out laughs and chuckles....but behind that temporary humor I get so satisfaction from anything. My friendships are dwindling and they are very few to begin with. 
I feel hopelessly miserable everyday of my life and there is no way to explain this feeling to anyone unless they have experienced it. 
I'm not sure what to do anymore or why I wrote this... I just needed to vent I guess. It never truly helps to vent though....nothing does...

I just want to FEEL something. I REALLY wish that I could be excited about things like everybody else seem sto be but here I am... locking myself inside of my bedroom and hiding away from the world. I can't face the world. I see the beauty of the world even though it's cruel but I cannot for the life of me make myself want to be a part of it. It is truly terrifying.

So, I can't tell anyone for a bunch of reasons. Yes, I have plenty of people who I can tell and who would be pissed if they knew I am keeping this to myself. But I do not want to burden anyone, I do not want to ""seek attention"" or be dramatic, I do not want to appear week, I do not want to be embarrassed, I do not want my kids to find out, and I don't need sympathy or anyone in my face about it. Also, I'm not at the point of doing it yet. I think about it probably only 70% of my day. I'm past the point of just daydreaming about it, and I'm on to the point of being cool with it, tempting fate a little, and making plans for the aftermath. It's just an emotionless, matter of fact, plan. I don't know how to explain it, maybe someone here can relate, but I think I'm more angry and fed up and ""fuck it"" than I am sad or depressed. Up until recently I felt a little silly bc on the surface my life looks A-ok. Nice marriage, nice job, awesome family, successful children, I'm not wealthy by any means but I've got plenty of spending money. I'm pretty attractive if I do say so myself lol No drug habit. So what's been my problem? Idk. Inside I am very lonely? Misunderstood? I feel like no one knows me at all, and those closest to me haven't a clue who I am. I guess that's probably my fault somehow but still. I carry far too much weight. My mind is always racing bc there's just so much to think about, worry about, stress about, and handle. Anyway, I felt weird over the past several months having suicidal thoughts bc seriously, wtf do I have to be suicidal for? So I jinxed myself lol In the past few weeks my husband has been diagnosed w cancer, our marriage took a nosedive, my father was diagnosed with cancer, two vehicles are falling apart, my pool pump died, my basement flooded, my laundry room sprung a leak, etc etc. So I took a small handful of benzos and washed them down with a couple beers. I knew it wasn't enough to do any real damage, and I got a damn good nap! Now I wonder how many more I can take, like, what's my limit? I can't say that I'm trying to kill myself yet, it's more like, oh well if it happens - if that makes any sense. For example I've found myself flying down the road at 90 mph just for a second and just for fun. Something I would never do! And just like when I took the pills, I didn't think about the affect it could have on other people until afterwards. Trust me I know what could happen to other people. So I thought about cutting myself. I've seen it on TV, I did similar things as a teenager. But I can't hide it. So then today I was trying to brainstorm ways to hurt myself that people can't see. What the hell is that lol!! Sometimes I think I must be delusional. Sometimes I think reality isn't exactly reality. Like I'm in a dream or a movie or that the entire world is just my life and nothing else is real. Like The Truman Show or Vanilla Sky or Inception or something dumb like that. But the great thing is, no one has a clue. Everyone thinks I'm ""the strongest person"" they know. Most would say I'm very put together, some would say they envy my life, all would say I'm a very lucky woman. Anyway, that's all I feel like rambling about for now. Thanks for reading if you did.",suicidal,high

"Scared if I use antidepressants that I won't be able to have sex again!Hello

I have really bad anxiety and depression which is getting worse - my therapist told me to try an antidepressant to help lift my mood and get me back on track - but after reading online I saw that most antidepressants can lead to ED and other sexual disfunction's (some even permanently, even after you stop the medication) - now as much as I want to get help for my depression, one of the things making me depro is ED and PE so I dont want to make that worse!

How common are these side effects and what are my options - if I dont take them I might kill myself and if I take them I can never have sex again!

"How do I do this? Trying to get help.Hi everyone, I've been lurking this sub for a few months now.I  have decided I really want to change my mindset, as it gets really tiring waking up every day feeling like you just want to give up. It doesn't help that my work always gives me anxiety, where at time I'd have to talk to HR and book the day off because of an anxiety attack. I have tried to book for an appointment a year ago through NHS (government), but it took 6 months for them to respond and they can only offer online or voice calls, which I could not take.

For context, I live in London. Currently living with my parents who don't know I have been depressed for years, and have occasionally been having suicidal thoughts, more frequently these past few months. The NHS offered treatment for my anxiety, but they said it would have to be done video or audio calls, sadly I cannot do this as I don't want my parents to know, and as I am working a 9-5, the only time I can do it is in the evenings or weekends, which most of the time my parents would be at home.

I came across this affordable therapy sessions, but I called them up and they said they only do zoom sessions. I told them about my situation and would rather have a face to face, but they really want to help me. Most of the ones I've found that offer face to face sadly cost way more than I can afford.

So, is there a way for me to do online therapy without being at home, or find a place to myself that I can rent for an hour or two?

I have come to my tether, I have been dealing with mental health issues for 20+ years and I can not deal with it anymore. I have good days obviously otherwise I would have not lasted so long.
The reasoning is this: to most it seems pathetic but to me it's a pretty big deal. My misses has decided to leave me due to her mental health which I am completely supportive of. I am so proud of her that she wants to better herself and concentrate on her life. I have been with her for 8 years, we have had some bad times but not the worse, we still love each other and care for one another, and there is always a possibility of it becoming a break rather than a split, but to me she was my life line for 8 years she has suppressed and helped my mind without even knowing it, just being there beside me was helping. Now that she has gone, my mind is going a million miles an hour. 
I have thoughts like, and yes these are strange, I am a manipulator but I don't want to be one, I have no one around me, I'm all alone literally. I am useless at everything I try to accomplish, I don't talk to my family even though they are all great, but I do and don't blame my mum, I have grown up watching my mum overdose, jump off cliffs and even trying to get run over. Etc etc etc I could probably list of dozens that just goes around and around.
So now I am at my tether I know this year or next year is my last. I'm not holding out hope that I am going to get better, I refuse to listen to anyone that tells me it's going to get better because let's be honest it isn't. I have had this issue for 20+ years it's not going to magically go away. I'm done.

Now a question, I have different methods I am going to try and I hope one is the key. No one is going to know because I don't talk to anyone as I said I am alone. Which is best?
Overdose on codeine?
Hanging myself? , my friend managed it and passed away so I know it's affective.
Or a mixture of both?

Don't respond with its all going to get better.

Thank you if you got this far. It's all just rambling and not much made sense but non the less it's real.",suicidal,high

"I'm bipolar and want to just end everythingI have bipolar II, am on 5 medications and might have to add a sixth. Life is hard and I struggle with mental illness every day. I am turning twenty-two next month and I am a junior studying psychology with a TESOL minor. I'm sitting here waiting for my boyfriend to finish his class and I feel so empty and alone. I don't want to burden anyone anymore. I was in a psych ward twice at the end of 2015. I feel like this will never get easier. Last night my boyfriend cried and held me because my only reason for not killing myself is because I am too afraid to die. He told me that shouldn't be my only reason.

But it is. And now that is even starting to go away. Yesterday was my boyfriend's twenty-first birthday, we celebrated and I got him a ton of stuff. Tonight we're going to a bar for his first time. I should be happy and excited but all I want to do is cry and sleep.

I'm having chronic nightmares. I wake up in the middle of the night from one, then I go back to sleep, and have another one. I haven't slept well in more than a week.

It is really affecting my boyfriend and that makes me want to kill myself even more- so he doesn't have to worry about me ever again. 

I don't know what I'm looking for, a pity party? Advice? Help?? I'm debating calling the suicide helpline. My mental illness affects everyone I know, and I'm at a breaking point.",suicidal,high

"So I'm planning on overdosing on hydrocodone/acetometophen, is that a painful way to go?The past couple months have been really bad, I'm 18 and I feel like a complete loser. I had a bike accident 2 years ago and everyday now my neck and back are hurting. I've always had problems with mental illness but things have gotten so bad lately. I'm so emotionally unstable and the pain makes it so much worse. The meds don't seem to be helping either. I couldn't even hold down my job and at this point I feel like I'm just dragging other people down. I've been dealing with social anxiety now and can't even have normal social interactions at this point so I isolate myself in my room. Nothing interests me anymore and there is nothing more I want out of life. I am so phycologically damaged I have to fake social interactions with people and am constantly uncomfortable. I thought about hanging myself but I chickened out. I'm awfully afraid of the pain of dieing or if I will fail and make my life worse. I know that 90mg of hydrocodone is enough to be lethal and if that doesn't kill me the acetometophen will.

"tiredI'm fifteen. I go to school every day. I'm a happy person. I love making my friends smile. I love making my teachers smile. People have told me my happiness is contagious. I always ask my friends how they're doing more than once throughout the day. No one ever really does the same for me.

I go to therapy. I have a psychiatrist. My doctor knows about my history with suicide and drug abuse. Yet it seems like all of the people I go to for my mental health have bigger worries. There's always someone else who has it ""worse"", and I don't understand that. I just want to scream and cry and shout at them. Why can't they see how much I'm suffering? Just because someone can't contain it as well as I can, how does that make them any more at risk than me?

I frequently self harm. I'm addicted to nicotine and I have been addicted to worse in the past. I haven't gone a single day in years without thinking of killing myself. I've attempted to kill myself some 30 odd times in 2018, and so far two times in 2019. My parents don't understand, and I don't mean that in an ""edgy teenager"" way, I mean my parents have walked in on me attempting suicide and have done nothing. They brush my actions under the rug with ""she wants attention"" or ""she's just being a typical teenager"".

Nobody understands. Seriously. No one understands. I've tried to talk to people, I've tried to talk to my friends, but every time I do, they look at me differently and treat me differently. I've tried to talk to my social worker. She doesn't understand because on the outside, I'm ""happy and carefree"".

I'm just so tired. Nobody sees how bad it is. When I'm finally dead, I know everyone is going to think that they could have done more. And the truth is they fucking could have.

"I'm so tired of trying.I used to have it all. I was married to the woman of my dreams, who treated me like a king. She gave me a purpose to live, a reason to get out of bed in the morning. She gave me my beautiful baby boy. But my joy was short lived. She got depressed, and grew resentful of me and my lack of money. I was working 50 hour weeks but the bills took every penny, and then some. She wanted to be at the end of the journey, when I was only just beginning. 

She left me. And took my son. 15 hours away from me to a different state. She never gave me a real reason. She said she still loved me but “she just couldn’t do it anymore”. Now I’m missing my sons first year of life, and he doesn’t even know who I am. 

I started cutting myself, on my thighs and on my chest where no one will ever see. It helped get rid of the pain for a second. 

I stopped seeing a purpose to life, to suffering any more than I already have. I lost my job, got evicted from my townhome, and went far into debt. I have no friends; I was a dumbass and let my life get completely absorbed by my love for my wife, and my friends stopped trying long ago. Now I’m living in the shittiest motel I can find, burning through the remains of my money.

I wake up every morning and look at my snubnose I have sitting on my night stand. I’ve only ever loaded one bullet, and it tempts me everyday. To finally stop feeling, existing. I’ve played Russian roulette 5 times so far but whatever higher power is out there wants me to continue suffering. But I’ve ran out of faith in myself.

I just play video games and binge watch anime but I feel so bored with being on this planet. I that there is an afterlife and I hope I get lucky.

"What do I do? I'm out of options.I've had to tell 'my story' many times, so I want to keep this brief. I was diagnosed with depression when I was 8. It's 10 years later, it's gradually gotten worse and worse. I would say I've mostly wanted to die for years, but now I'm seriously considering it.

I have no life left in me. I've always been anxious as hell, and struggled really badly socially. School was hell. As a result of illness and anxiety I developed Chronic Fatigue Syndrome. Had to leave school half a year and didn't get any qualifications, had terrible attendance and couldn't keep up with the work. (Which means no job options, no 6th form college.) I just couldn't go in most days, I was so tired and so anxious. I felt like I was going to suffocate there, and they all hated me. Even the teachers, they didn't understand I was ill.

After I left I spent **18 months** isolated, my old 'friends' wanted nothing to do with me. All thought I faked being ill to get out of school. I had *no one.* 

My anxiety got so bad I couldn't leave the house often for weeks, even months at a time. I eventually made plans to go to music college. Months later I somehow got my shit together and started the year. It was not easy. I put in every last drop of motivation and energy, I was exhausted. And this was just to socialize and make the 45 minute journey there everyday. 3 months in I get fucked over again and get tendonitis, from working too hard.

I finished the course, barely. But my wrist has not improved (nearly a year of tendonitis), 2nd year starts in 2 days. I can't do it again. Barely making it through exams, not practising while dealing with severe pain in my wrist and arm. I just can't. It's a waste of money. So I'm going to have to tell them I'm not taking up my place. All my work is gone. My career hopes as a musician are dead. I'll have to say goodbye to all my friends, it was so hard to make friends. I'm not close to anyone, but I got by. Playing guitar was my only outlet, it got me through those 18 months. It was all going to pay off because I could play music. Now I have nothing left I nearly cry just thinking about it everyday. Staring at my guitar on the wall, I had a future. I was one of the best on the course.

So I'm now facing a year alone in my bedroom again, more depressed than ever, frustrated and angry again. I've tried so hard but it's just not going to work out for me. I have no education or future. I just want it to end. 

4/5 years ago I took too many Prozac (and since decided never to try medication again.) I don't remember the dose, I was meant to take one a day and  oncetook 5. I just wanted something to happen, someone to know the pain I was in. I was kind of shaky for a week and it died down. I never told anyone I did it. Now I'm thinking, fuck? What if I really messed something up in my head or my body?

I don't need emotional support. I need a plan. And no one can tell me what I'm meant to do. No doctor, therapist, friend or relative has a clue. Because there is no solution, and so I'm just left weighing up the merits of suicide.

"It came back.I am a M(12). I live in a very christian neighborhood.I have attempted suicide in 2017, but have obviously failed. After that I started seeking out help keeping it a secret from everyone including my parents. I recovered by the mid-end of spring 2018, and have accidentally told some people that I have attempted suicide, but luckily they think it was a joke.

The reason for the depression (I have never actually been diagnosed but had all of the symptoms) is abuse I have been yelled at and beaten since kindergarten (about 5 years old) and have been humiliated and bullied for my looks (overweight) since the start of primary school. And increasing pressure to fulfill my high expectations (straight As). And during all of this being told that the abuse was ""normal"".

Ever since my recovery I have been making efforts to get slimmer which were mostly stopped by my parents saying that I cant go on a diet because I was so young (instead of a diet I just started eating healthier), my dad stopped beating me because he knew I was getting stronger (working out) and would fight back. But the emotional manipulation and verbal abuse did not stop. 

On the start of august I was staying at my Aunts and Uncles house for a week. And that week was great, because I had no expectations, I kept working out, I kept a stable weight, I had a cat who made it way less lonely being inside most of the time. But then I came back home. And on the SECOND DAY of me being back my dad just came out of nowhere and tried to kiss me, but my arm got in the way. Immediately he started yelling at me saying that I have no respect for him, that I do not know what love, and that I do not love him, and how ungrateful I am for all he has done for me. He also yelled that    he will take away all my rights including free speech. And whenever I tried to say anything he would cut me off and yell ""DO NOT ANSWER ME!"". He said that he hated how I was relaxed when he started yelling at me.

This is after another similar case that happened a few weeks ago when we went on a walk and he started yelling at me because food is not all I want from him. As I said this is similar to the case described above. Except that in this one I had a mental breakdown, he punched me, and gave me a promise that we will never get angry at each other ever again (I knew this was bullshit) except if I ""screw up"".

And the day after he yelled at me, made me cry enough to fill 100 of those ""male tears"" mugs, and broke a promise. The next day he acted as if nothing happened. One thing he got right that night is that I do not love him, I realized I do not love him 2 years ago. If it was not for the laws of this country I would have murdered him, but I could not even defend myself because of how emotionally overwhelmed I was, I could not say anything I just imagined killing him.

And ever since that day the suicidal thoughts came back, slowly but they did. And now I do not have emotional support I don't know who to tell this, except you.",suicidal,high

"I'm not sure if I am able to reach out for help.I have a few various resources that I can take opportunity with to seek help.. such as my counsellor at a program (for women who have gone through trauma) I am attending.. my general doctor who's known me since I was four years old.. possibly my eating disorder psychiatrist as well.. but I honestly am beating myself up and telling myself to run away from them all and die.

I tell myself I am not worthy enough to be attending the program I am for women who have gone through trauma, because I never suffered the type of abuse that is physical except for a couple incidents when I was a kid. So I tell myself I am a fraud, none of the psychological abuse I went through meant anything. 

I tell myself I am not worthy enough to be seeing a doctor at an eating disorder clinic, because I do not fit into the text book case of anorexia or bulimia. My eating disorderness does not carry any clarity, and I have no clear grasp on it. I tell myself I am just seeking attention, and it does not matter that I suffer from not eating generally at all. 

I tell myself I am not worthy enough to be seeing my general doctor to seek out help with medication, because even though I was diagnosed bipolar eight years ago that diagnosis was retracted sometimes soon after and was most likely wrong. So I most likely have no mental illness other than random cases of depression and once major anxiety. So in result, I am not worthy to be asking for medication and asking for help to figure out what is wrong with me. I am also not worthy to go see her and ask for a updated evaluation because I've had so many in my life and none of them resulted in anything clear. I am just seeking attention, I must be. I am a fraud, somehow. 

I feel I deserve no help. I feel I shouldn't trust anyone. I am just a confusing, unclear person that it's pointless to waste time on me. 

Just recently I moved into a new house and am renting out a room. I am living with my mother, and I feel I have literally walked into a nightmare. I was living with her before, but back than I was renting out a basement suite so I was not really near her. Now, whenever we come in orbit of another I am consistently triggered and feel like my brain is overloading and melting and like I just wanted to hit myself and cry. I won't bother explaining how she is a trigger to me, because I've tried too explain it to some people and they always take her side and say I need to grow up. 

The thought of suicide has become such a consistent thing for me. I feel like my world is shutting in on me and I'm backed into a corner in a dark room and no one can be trusted because no one understands me. 

I can't tell if I am severely depressed or not. All I know is I'm constantly panicking about feeling my world is shutting in on me. I'm constantly thinking about suicide and not just doing it but so much more than that. I'm constantly thinking about what kind of effects it would have on people who know me, what I would potentially miss out on, what it would really mean for me, if it's really worth it.

The scary part is, is that even though I have not gone and committed suicide sometimes I honestly feel like I have. I feel so immensely far from everything that sometimes I realize I feel dead.

I don't know what to do with myself.

I am such a disappointment. My family (ie mother, brother and his girlfriend) is such a trigger. I honestly would be so much happier if I never had to come across them again. I would be beyond relieved, because I honestly never have felt part of the family I was born into and since my brother's girlfriend came into the picture I have gone through so much critical judgement from her.

I don't know if I have it in me to keep living in this world. I just want to go to sleep and never wake up. Sometimes I even think about going back on drugs even though I've been drug free for three years. I just want to escape from everything. Sometimes I think about admitting myself into a hospital because the anger I feel makes me feel like tarring everyone in my path apart. I'm not worth any of it.

No. Shut up. Don’t discredit the amount of courage, pain, and mental fortitude it takes to go against your every instinct and finally free yourself from this pain. 

Yes I am strong. I am strong because everyday I’m building up the courage to kill myself. 

And I will kill myself. You can’t stop me. I don’t care if you love me, because you sure didn’t act like it when I was suffering. It’s too late to say “I love you.”

I’m not even going to write letters anymore. No one is worth writing letters to. Suicide is my decision to make and I can chose to end my life because it’s my goddamn life.

"My mother just called me a dog, again. I just want someone to know.She just called me a dog. Why? Because I asked her not to look through my phone. I shouldn't have, I don't why I said that. It didn't matter if she did. I just wanted some privacy. She said it doesn't matter because no one talks to me anyways anyways. I'll never have any friend, because I don't deserve one. Here's a list of other things she's called me:

\-a parasite, many times

\-pest. 

\-useless, worthless 

She's also asked my why I was born, why I don't just die. She said that I ruin every single conversation of her and my sister when I enter it. That I just want an excuse to cry. Every time she talks to someone about my good grades it doesn't mean she's proud of me, it's just an obligation to talk about her kids. I don't make her proud, she would rather not be my mother. That she doesn't see a future in me. I don't either. I just want to die, that's my future. I know my brain capacity is low, I know I'm a loser in so many ways, and I just want it to end. It's no my mother's fault or those people in Year 6 who gave me a card saying they don't want to be my friend. It's me, I'm the reason. Suicide is the only way out, or maybe I should go mad? There's no other way. 

Maybe I could've been a more accomplished person if I wasn't so mentally RETARDED. My grades are good, but I can't move on. My grades may be high but it means nothing when I'm such as fucking loser. I don't want to waste any money on university because I don't deserve it. This feeling has overtaken anything I do, no matter how fun it may be. Some time ago I had the graduation ceremony, I was the fucking valedictorian and I wore a pretty dress, and people actually fucking complimented me! When I went back home I just fell to the floor because it didn't make me happy, it should have, but it fucking didn't. What will make me happy? What will not make me feel like my future is nothing and that I'm worthless? 

I somehow made friends at school but after I leave school, I won't. My image of relationships are distorted after seeing my parents fracture each other's limbs and through burning hot tea and chairs at each other. When I think of a relationship I imagine being smashed against the wall until I bleed. And I want it. I want to hurt? I don't have the strength to talk to anyone, to feel interested in talking to anyone, though I do wish I could just weep one someone's shoulder. When I'm at the cafeteria with my friends I finish my food quickly because I'm scared they'll leave. I constantly wonder if everyone is just fucking annoyed by me but just don't want to be rude.  Or maybe they don't care at all, I'm just some idiotic girl who acts all goofy because she that seems to be the only way to not fucking burst into tears.

Some months back a speeding car almost crashed on me but it didn't. I was close to smiling as it swerved, but it didn't hit me! Why didn't it fucking hit me? Why? Every time I fall sick I just desperately hope that it's a terminal disease, but no. It's not. It's not. i JUST WANT A FUCKING DISEASE TO KILL ME. I just go to sleep every night that I don't wake up, but it doesn't work.

And I don't think it's wrong. It's not wrong to want to die, it's not wrong to kill yourself. This is just another kind of the Survival of the Fittest, and I'm the weak one.

"I would rather kill myself more than anything. In the last decade from ages 10 to 19, I have been suicidal and hurting from plenty of things that have happened to me in my life.

My family isn't exactly the most healthiest thing to have in my life, and I really need to stay as far away from them as possible. With that needing to be done, it takes a lot out of me. 

I have plenty of great friends, but I don't exactly believe I am that great myself; I'm unrelatable, shy, not as smart as I would like to be, lack knowledge, and a bundle of problems. 

My moods and emotions are way too off for me to properly function anymore and it really scares me. Everyday feels like a labyrinth for me, because I don't know exactly where my mind is going to go and I'm always going to regret something I say or do. 

I'm too wrecked to do anything anymore. I'm unable to work, make proper conversations, do anything normal and feel comfortable, or even love myself most of the time. I'm way too distorted and emotionally wrecked to live. 

I have stayed here for the people who have been there for me, but it's gone to the point all I really smile for anymore is the thought of ending my life. I see everything for how it *really* is and I'm tired of it. 

I can't express in words for how I think or feel, but I would definitely take the step on killing myself if it were fast and simple.

"Help?I don't really understand how to start this, or even explain it. I'll just start with describing my life. This might be long so if you're not looking for a long read this isn't for you.. I suppose.

I am 17 years old and i'm a guy. I fucking hate my life. On weekdays, I wake up, go to school, go to work(on work days), go home, and eat and sleep. I repeat this for a majority of my week until the weekend. I usually work all weekend so I wake up at around 11am and do the same thing I do on the week excluding school. I work at a supermarket as a bagger. Now the job isn't all the bad but some of the people I work with are so fucking condescending. This isn't even the worse part. This is something i'm sure everyone deals with.

I'm going to move on from work now. I'm not exactly the most religious type. I don't believe in anything. I'm atheist. Now I haven't always been atheist but after my parents divorced and the clouds dispersed and showed me how shit my life really was getting I made up my mind. There is no ""all loving god"". I always feel so empty. I feel worthless and my life has no meaning. I have nothing I like doing other than playing CS:GO with some online friends(I have no real friends irl). I have ""friends"" irl, but really they're just people I talk to while i'm at school. Every other week we might go and hang out but it's quite obvious they don't actually enjoy my company. 

I used to have a girlfriend that I actually am pretty sure I loved. I found out later in the relationship that she was extremely suicidal and she self-harmed. I obviously attempted to help her but that did nothing. High school relationships are for suckers. I now know why you cannot simply get someone who self-harms to stop. I began to sh in the middle of that relationship and did it 4 months after it ended. One day I managed to stop and I lost the blades I used to do it so I just haven't began again since. I have contemplated suicide multiple times. I think about doing it everyday. I just haven't came up with the courage to do so. I'm a small guy so I can't do much about everyone and their insults. I have problems mentally and i'm starting to get it now. I need to be pointed in the right direction or even helped by a professional but i'm scared to tell anyone about my problem.",suicidal,high

"I Should Be Happy, but I'm Losing My Will to LiveI don't have any friends to talk to and just needed someplace to get this off my chest. I've never posted to Reddit before, thought I'd give it a try.

I haven't had the easiest life, I grew up poor in a single parent household like most Americans. Even still, it could've been worse. I've always been depressed since my youngest years, but didn't know it was depression until I was 20 years old when I was admitted into a mental health facility following a suicide attempt. I had just gotten out of an abusive relationship and was recovering from anorexia.

Since then, I met the love of my life and moved to his hometown on the west coast--2400 miles from my hometown. We've been together a little over 7 years now. With him I've experienced so much and enjoyed life so much; he's taught me so many things about myself and showed me how important I am when I start feeling less than myself. He's been my own personal counselor when I'm depressed, anxious, paranoid, etc. He proposed to me on my birthday 2 years ago.

Today, he's still the best part of me. I've been so sick with numerous curable ailments since late 2016 and he's by my side every step of the way. We have plans laid out for our future but I can't get over this gnawing feeling inside. I'm tired of fighting to feel better. I've been bed-ridden for over a month now and I haven't been able to work since the first week of February. I'm so tired of ""giving my body time to heal"". I went from going out and living every day to laying in bed feeling miserable both physically and mentally. I'm nearing the end of my rope but my fiancé is the only thing keeping me from letting go. 

I don't know what to do anymore and living is more like a chore now. I'm stuck in limbo trying to find a way out of this pain. Even though I don't want to break my finances heart, I really just don't want to live like this anymore. I'm waiting on test results from my doctor that may explain all my symptoms. I'm not religious, but I'm praying that I have this certain illness, as one small surgery could heal me nearly completely. If the test comes back negative, I'm right back where I started and I'm not sure I can keep living in painful mystery. ",suicidal,high

Canr stop thinking about it.  I hate who and what I am with such a passion it is the driving force of who I am, but if course that is weakness right? And that just makes more problems.  The fighting hurts her, hurts me, hurts the kids.  She will not control herself around them.  I can't leave.  There is only 1 option.  The best option, accidental death.  The source of ALL problems will be gone. And peace will reign.  Insurance $$ will cover for a bit, and everyone will move on with support of friends and church.  They all will be so much better off without me there.  You may say kids need their dad.  You are right.  But in this scenario, being there means contention fights and BIG problems.  Without me.

Not all guys, but certain types of guys. 

This is dedicated to the fucking horny negative IQ guys.  If you say “send nudes”, make chad memes, or is just sexist in general, this post is for you. 

If you’re nice, respectful, not sexist and stuff, then this post is NOT dedicated to you. Thank u for being respectful if you are like this.

So simps....

You guys are here thinking we’re your sex toys. I’m sure me and the girls here are tired of receiving messages saying,“Send thicc thighs”, you pathetic horny fucks.

Girls were not created to arouse men. Guys use us like FUCKING TOYS. FUCK YOU. If you’re a pathetic virgin that jerks off to hot video game characters and you ask girls to send nudes, go to fucking hell. You make us not wanna be girls.

Some of you guys think we’re weak. Well guess fucking what, we bleed every month, we get fucking cramps, we give birth which is one of the most painful things ever, and all you guys do is get horny and ask girls to send thick thighs. Everyday we have to be careful outside since there might be some weird dude who might kidnapp and rape and sell us, yes, WE DEAL WITH THIS EVERYDAY. Girls can’t even wear the clothes we want, like if a girl wants to show her skin, she can’t do it without a guy staring at her boobies. (Personally I’m thinking about wearing one of those things you wrap around your chest so it looks like you don’t have boobs because IM UNCOMFORTABLE ALL THE TIME) 

And if you see a girl without makeup, you’ll say, “she’s ugly”. Like we don’t have to look pretty for you guys lmfaooo. WE ARE NOT YOURS. 

And fuck the girl stereotype, that we like tik tok and cute toys and makeup and all that stuff. Some girls do like those things, but NOT ALL OF US. FUCK YOU 

The moral of the story: It’s hard being a girl, so stop being a fucking dick. Y’all shit on girls all the time, as simple as Chad memes and [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/teenagers/comments/k6mpvt/fuck_girls/?utm_source=share&amp;amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;amp;utm_name=iossmf).

Edit: lmao you guys are sad, some yall really getting salty of this post. Ima lose hope in humanity. 

Look I know that men have hard lives too. Maybe lives as hard as women, but more when it comes to society. The toxic mindset of men “not having feelings and have to toughen” up makes things hard but this post is dedicated to a women’s problem about horny men. Stop being fucking selfish for once.

"One of my old friend committed a suicide which was planned over 2 years, nobody solve reason behind.My school friend (i haven't seen him since 1+ year) committed suicide 5 days ago, jumped from 13th floor. 

I want to know if you have any idea why, or have heard about something similar to this.

He left notes, says that he don't want to life in this world where all we do is earning and spending money, and it's too boring for him. And also mentioning a girl in a 1 sentence. But the problem is:

  
1)Over 2 years, he was mentioning mm/dd in his Instagram pictures, posts, which we just realized that is the day and month he killed himself.

2)He has little tattoos on his chest and arm, mostly of sun, moon, Saturn and butterfly. Some people say he told them that he was talking about we will be go to Saturn after death, and  reincarnation

3)He mentioned that he is in a better place on letter

4)His family says he was talking someone in English for a long time on smartphone. He was Turkish.

5)Before hours of his suicide, he bough new clothes, put his all clothes and backpack orderly on the top floor and jumped

6) Finally, as i knew him, he was definitely now smart enough to plan something like this more than 2 years before. He didn't believe in god, but had no problem with living. Everyone says that even 1 day before his death he was acting just normal

&amp;#x200B;

"After giving thought, I think it's best for me to go for good.This is a long post. Apologies if it's too long but I need to get this off my chest.

I have posted here before, and hardly anyone responded to that. I posted some time ago about my high school life and how miserable I was. I also mentioned something about me being immature for my age (21). And I think I mentioned something about how difficult it is to get a job in a country when your race is everything. 

Ever since then, if you thought my life couldn't get any worse, it has. I eavesdropped on my parents I heard them say what a nuisance I was since I was 1. I was such an inconvenience to everyone and people today poked fun at me for doing that whenever they mention my early life. I was on the brink of saying fuck you to about 20 people but there was 20 of them and 1 of me so I was powerless. If that was the case when I was like that, why couldn't they give me away to another family if they saw me as an inconvenience?

School was hell too. From being harassed, to being picked on by teachers, to being irrelevant to everyone around, and when my grandfathers died, I became even more miserable, then I was on the brink of suicide. The reason I didn't is because even though I may be immature in almost everyone's eyes, but I was intelligent for being a miserable introvert, and with hardly any help from my parents since they didn't do accounting, I ended up with mostly B Grades at a school were averages are lower D's to F's.

But those grades mattered little as now, up til this day, 4 years after school, I cannot get a simple job to get myself some income because of the country I live in. And with the stuff I mentioned in my previous post, and with me only knowing that my parents talked about me childhood behind my back, my school hell and cannot get a job, I don't think it's fair if I continue in vain to live a happy life.

I have given thought about suicide a few times, but with this new information of my early days, why do I even exist?! For what reason was I brought up to live a life of hell? And if commit suicide, what consequences are there for Hindus that do commit it?

I'm going to do something I won't tell any family member. I'm going to live on the street for a little qhile, risk being mutilated (crime and murder rates is extremely high, and pretend I don't belong to anybody. I want my family to experience what life will be like if I never existed.

And if they didn't miss me, that's the final nail in my coffin.

I am currently seeking treatment for mental health. My mental health sometimes interferes with my work. I have a family history of mental health issues. I'm not sure if I would seek help for mental health issues. I don't think there would be negative consequences for discussing mental health issues. Additional thoughts: I was (wrongly) diagnosed clinically depressed at 12 then bipolar I at 15 and medicated for a decade until decided myself to go drug free. Since then I've never been happier. Insomnia and my insatiablility for learning and programming have always had a symbiotic  relationship.It might also bear mentioning that I'm self-employed in addition to my more traditional day job.,depression,medium

"I'm WorthlessI have nothing to look forward to except burdening everyone around me.

I'm got so much physical and mental illness that I'll never be able to manage a job, have a relationship, do anything meaningful. I applied for disability and it took them about five seconds before they just said 'yeah, this guy's never going to be of use to any employer'. These issues will never go away and no medicine has helped improve them.

Every friend I've ever had has forgotten or betrayed me. I have people who still go out of their way to make sure I'm not allowed to interact with new people. I don't even want to anymore, since seeing other people having fun or living normally just reminds me how pathetic I am.

Whenever I tell others my problems they just lie to me. 'Things will get better!' No they won't. 'You have worth!' No I don't. 'You'll get your dream job, your perfect relationship, you'll be happy!' No, I fucking won't. Instead of proving to me I have value they just beg me to lie to myself, and tell me to read a book or something.

The only reasons I'm still around are keeping my family from being saddened, and because I'm not entirely sure if being dead will actually make me feel any better.

"I’m lost and don’t know what to doI’m a high schooler and recently got my grades back. 3 Fs, 2Ds, and 2bs this was the lowest I’ve ever had. I lost any chance of getting to any of the colleges I wanted to go to, and my back ups, and the emergency ones as well. I literally lost any chance at getting into a good college and that has ruined all my life plans. I wanted to be a inventor but I failed my engineering class, I wanted to be a movie director but I failed my English class, I wanted to be an entrepreneur but I failed my business class. Every plan I had is gone, I haven’t told my parents because I’m afraid of their reaction. My school counselor pretty much just said “Too bad so sad, but hey it’s not our fault it’s yours, You dumba**”. I’ve been struggling with thoughts of suicide for years and I usually flip a coin when I’m at the edge, three times it’s landed heads and it landed heads again today. If it lands tails then I kill myself but whenever I flip the coin I hope it lands on both heads and tails. I don’t know how much longer I can keep living like this, I’m just so tired all the time and honestly suicide sounds like my only escape. 

I have people I love and do things I enjoy but with quarantine I lost my rowing scholarship and was kicked off the team. My friends are all moving away and my dad can barely be considered because of cancer. I have nothing left now or for the future, please what do I do now? I don’t live but I’m afraid to die. I’m a lazy fat sack of s*** who can’t do anything right, what can I do, is there anything I can do?

"The Worst Part of Contemplating SuicideFor me, the very worst parts of contemplating suicide are,

You don’t get to have a rational conversation with your closest confidant about what you’ve been thinking about, the options you’ve been weighing out. 

You don’t get to express your thoughts and feelings to strangers, friends, family or doctors without a 911 call being made.  

You don’t get to ask for an unbiased opinion on whether or not you should. 

You don’t get to explain to people face to face why you are considering suicide, why you believe this to be what is best. 

The entire monologue of your mind and reality becomes this MASSIVE secret, which you’re deathly afraid of anyone knowing about...because ultimately that would result in complete loss of free will- as well the option to end your life. 

And the very worst, 

You don’t get to hug, say goodbye, and tell your people how much you’ve always loved them. 
How many nights they’ve kept you alive.
How you’ve only been standing for this long because of them. 
You don’t get to tell them that you love them so much. That you’re so terribly, dreadfully and horrifically sorry. That the amount of guilt you feel is completely immeasurable.

"I just can'tI'm just so tired. There's never any money and that means that I can't get this horrible stomach pain and nausea to stop. I had been smoking pot, but now that doesn't help anymore. 

I'm just tired. I have a right to be. Nothing in my life, nothing in 46 years has gone right. 

My parents business was raided by the IRS when I was a kid and my parents got into a lot of trouble. My dad was an alcoholic, totally a wonderful, reliable man - but he died right after he waved me off at the airport gate (for my cross country move that was going to make my life SOMETHING.) My mother could be a violent bitch, but sometimes okay. My sister is cruel. None of my family talks to me because I moved away 20 years ago. I left everything I knew back on the east coast.

If you're thinking of doing that - don't. You are going to need those people - even if it's JUST ONE - that anchor you. I have no anchor to stay in this world anymore. 

My husband is distracted, busy, 4 hour commute, when he's home he's on his iPhone. And his body is too big to have satisfying sex with him.

I'm no prize myself, but I know that relationships aren't going to fix my life even if the one with my husband, and the ones with my kids, improves. There's no improving me. I can help my husband a lot by not being here. He says he'd die without me, but he wouldn't. People say that all the time. They don't die.

I have a few hundred mg's of medicine and a bottle of rum and I really just want to go to my bedroom with them and make everything just ... I don't know...just, quiet. Everything. 

I am so lonely. There is no point to what I'm doing. I take up a small corner of my house and hide inside for months on end. I've tried dozens of ways to meet women my own age, or anyone at all that would be my friend in real life, but in 32 years I haven't had a friend. They all deserted me when I got pregnant in high school. 

That baby was 2 months premature. The second baby was good. The third baby had seizures after birth for some reason and now has extreme ADHD/ODD and is almost 16, so he'll probably be better off.  If I really think about it, if I'm gone, it will be a sure thing that he'd get to a psychiatrist and get on the right meds and have a real life, but there's no reason for him to take his psychologist seriously right now.

My oldest son has my anxiety disorder, but he can leave the house on his own sometimes. I can't. He doesn't really talk to me much although I text him a lot.  He never answers and I can see that he saw my texts.

My middle son is living in my house while going to college. He's 27 and going to be a nurse. 

Meanwhile, my husband just passed his 90 day mark at the new job he got, after his position was ""retired"" at his old company, and the pay isn't more. We really needed it to be more.

My house burned down in 1998, like down to the ground. 2 years later I moved to the west coast after splitting up with the man I loved because an old friend from high school raped me and my husband didn't believe me that it was rape. Raped repeatedly. I am paying for that every day of my life.

In May of 2019 our family has to move because our landlord of 5 years wants to sell. We've never paid late or caused any problems. But, our rent is lower than other houses and so my husband thinks we're going to buy a house, which is a joke, because everything here costs three times as much as it should, so it's looking like a tent at a KOA and tethering so he can work remotely. (He starts working from home full time soon. I'm not really excited about that since I'm not used to having him around all day every day and when he is home all we do is fight, until it's time to watch tv, then we do that - he goes to bed, I stay up all night so I can sleep all day so I don't ""feel the loneliness.""  If I'm sleeping I can't hurt, right?

Well, that's the idea with the pills and the rum.

I don't actually think that humans matter. On a universe-level, think about it; what does any of what we're doing matter? It's not like anyone in 2 generations is going to remember a single thing about most of us, especially me.

Oh, but I'll be a checkbox on a medical intake form some person is filling out - ""yes, there is Type 2 diabetes in my family.""

And a FUCKING WORD about that...I got Type 2 diabetes from a medication that a Nurse Practitioner gave me to help with my severe panic attacks. It's a beta blocker and doesn't allow adrenaline to affect your heart rate. It also elevates your blood glucose hellishly, which I was not warned about, and thus...I got diabetes.  ""Oh, hey - sure, I'm an AARNP - I have prescribing authorization -let's just load my patients up on WAYYYY too many drugs....then they'll chill out!"" That was her motto.  I was up to 12mg of xanax a day at one point.  The amount of pills that I have to take is so great that last night I tried swallowing them and choked, then threw up into my starbucks cup and felt like the biggest loser in the world.

So...the xanax is sitting here and the rum is wherever my husband last watched tv. 

And I'm so tired.",suicidal,high
"It all failed; I would like to read why in hell shouldn't I kill myself?Let's just start from the very beginning.

Age 15/Almost 16 :

I just dropped out High School, finally free from any kind of filthy wasting time institution filled with monkeys as classmates, decaying structures and absent teachers.
My Nation is really at such a point, thus I just decided on my own to not get involved in people or either decay for the rest of my projecting life.

It was the end December 2013 and I would've been 16 in just three months at the very firsts of April.
I always suffered from some kind of depression since bornt but never really gave a care both because I always found Reason and Mind to be stronger along the fact for which I never really cared about myself before my social priority, thus getting people and youngsters around my age to follow what I would've explained to be the path for some political projects I would like to not talk about here. It will may sound strange, but because of my Nation situation that's why every single child here despise of his interest seems to now be forced to bear and understand, in order to survive on his own behaviour as well.

I finally thought I would've been free to live as a self-taught Autodidact, throught what I always believed to be the best Polymath's type of habitat and circumstance, now being able to just study whatever I needed for both my projects and all kind of educations, perhaps even Graduating High School in just one/two years by giving my exam as a self-taught, which is here possible, even though it really seems to be not necesarry anymore here, considering neither University students get to have a job.
Not to mention our University students here show to usually behave like arrogant brats whom's school have been paid by daddy and just flee away in other country while STILL complaining about here even not doing anything to change the situation.

I already had all my projects ready, every single discipline/subject was chosen from a specific type of education and school, so I could get the best and advanced details about every each one of them (For example Scientific school schedule subjects for chemistry and such, Mechanic Institute for mechanics, Language obviously for languages, Literature, Electrnocis and much more).

The course of the projects sadly had to mature throught time, though, becoming thus devided differently in mainly: Studying eight hours, lightly training every hour, eating every six hours since even by working out since six years I still am underweight and struggle with food, then having to take care of the projects when finishing studies, going to the gym for two hours, eating and making food for the next days, going to sleep four hours, going for a night job like the baker one or either security guard, then starting from the beginning.

Doing all this should have been the daily routine at least since I was 16... But here comes the real problem.

I was like REALLY stressed out after three times trying to get in some kind of institute and in the first one in which I couldn't pass for the next class I have been rejected for having been too many time absent...
If I really have to say I've never and EVER been absent to a single class in my entire school life until that point, barely not even when really sick... I just started feeling strange, nervous, slow, depressed and sometimes had to remain all night awake trying to desperately drink coffee while studying, not being able to remain awake all day during class.

After that I thought it would've been better, always talking about December 2013 and after the third institute which was both a scam and from which I've been betrayed by the only two girls I've directly trying to be friends with.
I always happen to start getting hated in life, no matter how much courtesy I show or who happens to be, and I really have known enough people to tell it isn't because of my behavious since I try to always test people since then by trying different behaviours and ""spountaneous"" one, not being emotional or either caring about ""getting"" people by instinct, even tho I always understand others due to my natural and matured perception in life.

That's also why other than school life I've always remained home, wasting my time.

Now, even being enthusiastic about my new life and everything I just started sleeping much more than usual, not feeling hope and everything else, even getting out of my house occasionally once every two months..

In all that period I met the wrong people who made me just lose time, even though I should've met people all around and not only internet for both political projects, social and personal matters.

I also matured the will to learn various courses when getting a job, such as music, the seaplane course in my region, other fighting courses than my usual Shaolin gym, thus I also started refusing my parents money being also now in my country's legal age of getting a job (16).

I also wanted to travel, know people, finally train regularry and get stronger other than gain weight (I'm 5'11 and 128/132 lbs, I can lose 11lbs by skipping a meal even after eating six a day for a week), then I wanted to FINALLY find a soulmate to hopefully make my spouse at 18 like projected, finish my projects, start my writing works along much more.

Another external point is that I've been hypersexual since bornt, sexually active sinec 11/12.
Literally after entering middle school I would've done my harem if I just had more determination and didn't get stuck at home, since because of my libido I would've been following and seducing girls everywhere.
Too bad I never had the courage/determination to ask a relationship, both because I'm inevitabely honest and both because until 14 I was a stupid brat who just wished sex and saw nothing wrong about what nowaday we call ""Friends with benefits"", but I always believed a relation ship was needed and I would'nt kneel in fron of a woman.

Hopefully time would've changed, I would start appreciate traditions like I always defended my culture after how many ancestors of mine have died for it, become a pure Nationalist and even knowing what biologically shows to be possible to be excludeed from a civilized and Rational society.
Leaving the political views aside, that made me think of how AWFUL is to get a girl just for sex, thus I wanted to find the only girl in life I would've gave my love and have sex with, since I would even now want that anyway, being my only real sin in life.

I'm now 18 in three months and still haven't had ANY sexual experience, except for some light touching from clothers with some girl at middle school and cousins... NOTHING.
I feel so frustrated, so ashamed, so lost... So failed.

Not really because I always thought holding verginity after 15 was pathertic and have always been sure I'd lose it at 14, but because it now connects with the fact that I couldn't find even a girl in life to whom do it with.... I mean, reading now even by novels other than true story of even people of 16/17 having sex makes me furiously rage and force me to sleep in order to not feel pain from depression, like I've done for two years now.

All this bullshit to say that everything I could've project in life, doing my routine, finding that, finishing that else and ALSO being able at 18 to marry and live in a good family house in the countryside with my bride, since in my family trees parents usually save money for their son/sons' home and even always telling I don't deserve a single cent from the others those money will be legally addressed to me... I won't be able to do it, because at 16 I could've moved my ass and remained active everyday, finding a girl with right properties to whom I could've ask out and make my woman... but instead didn't anything.

I spent time getting active just one week a month just so I felt the strenght to make myself to eat and wash myself... That's it.
I have obviously done something like... Two travels? Filled the fridge by shopping meals for just one summer?
That was it, I didn't even travel during summer like the idiot I am because I STILL was that stubborn, wanitng to earn MY money and remaining at home, trying to get a job just FOUR TIMES in two years... 

I just couldn't find hope and thought that I didn't deserve to travel without a constructive/cultural purpose like I meant to, either to find a girl outside and to view cultural place, meeting people of that location... I didn't get around in summer to have ""fun"" or get laid after so many years virgin, because firstly I don't believe in ""fun"" and also I thought I would've finally see my bride to whom promise my purity..

In these last months I just lost it... Asked many times my parents to give me euthanasia since I hadn't the strenght to finish myself like I had to do two years ago and am now projecting to travel around before dying to get laid like I wanted for so much time, since I also have spent all my life on my computer knowing Eromanga works and maturing a culture about it, getting to work even by resulting and maturing more than commonly than others just for the 10/20% of my personal studies which I conducted since I had school, like computer science and else.
I also get furiously jealous, angry and much more else when even finding a mere male character to have 16 or less years in those works... I mean, why couldn't I?

All these years I could've also studied Computer Sceince very well and now can't even make a program, since all I know is some HTML bullshit, some SQL and just have started C, even having wanted to code since I was 11...

The last institute in which I've been there was a girl in particular three months older than me very cute and who liked Ghibli movies... I just felt like I was getting hated by her for some suspect reason, so I just left also because that school was a private scam paid my parents who never inform themselve, even after I gave them the warning and just suggested to finally send me to a normal school with girls as well, having been until the third institute in just all boys schools for Computer Science studies.

I met again with that girl some months ago after nearly TWO YEARS and even after giggling, telling me she missed me, receiving from mt a 40$ amethyst collar as a present and everything, she just kept ignoring me on whatsapp, considering we live far from each other, telling me she found me annoying even nearly even writing her to in fact NOT annoy her in anyway.. Just for attention.

That was the second time I fallen in love for a girl, considering during the third school I would've show myself for her in front of her house in the morning with freezing cold and just some shirt, since I always try to give example in any way of youth and strenght, nowadays in which even with 10 degrees people here act like Eskimo.

The first time was with a girl from middle school I just stalked some time in order to approach her ever since the end of school, never getting able to... At the end at 15 I fel the righr courage and after many times under her house I just rang the bell and asked if she could talk... I couldn't hear well because the intercome had poor sound, but could understood she couldn't/didn't want to come down for some reason and meet me.



Now, except for not caring about all these and that in three months I'll be damn eighteen years old... How the hell do I cope with all this without just hanging myself right now?

I couldn't know even a single girl in my entire life, since I never had a relation and none I got in these two years.
I never could have any sexual experience, holding it in to lose it for a bride.
I couldn't get a job to save money for my future.
I didn't even finish my COMPUTER SCIENCE studies, and I'm not talking about Electronicts, Mechanics and all that bullshit to both understand some jobs and get by highschool degree...
I couldn't train myself and eat properly for more than two days before getting depressed again, having to sleep to not feel hurt (even for 20 hours and having to feast).
I haven't been writing anything about all the projects I had to work on.
I didn't travel anywhere.


I've done fucking NOTHING in two years and even by knowing to never have been able to get even sexa t my age connects everything else to make me feel shit.

Even if I give it all like always I've done it life it would eventually fail, thus I feel FORCED to save my few energies remained and just look at how people who don't even work their ass on anything get every merit.
The last society's burocracy in which I failed was my driving license for driving the motorcycle 125cc,
I hadn't the strenght and motivation to study the theory NOT because I was a lazy ass but because all the questions where without any kind of reasonable logic, written badly, poorly and just showed discrepance between every question and answer.
I studied anyway and had to REMEMBER BY NOTION every single damn one even though it was impossible to remember them all for how many there were, considering it is indeed NOT possible as mentioned by everyone to remember them all.
Now you would think I just have to find the trick and reason, well let me tell you something: Those question don't have any particular logic side to which you could even try to reason about, thus you have to know them by mnemonic tracts.
I obviously failed, but got them all right the next time: Studying only in three days occasionally.

The next time I had to drive I found myself forced to ask help to some of my mother's friends who had even bigger bikes in order to learn Gears and everything, since all the shitty schol which I sadly paid instead of doing as a self-taught was ""Watch and learn"" or either give impossible instructions without letting me practice.

I learn gears and to ride after the third lession, thus THREE HOURS.

The next times I had to one who could legally make me drive on the road and with whom I could learn as a self taught, THUS I had to be THROWN on the road without any knowledge by my schoo, get pression, stopped every two time and never getting to drive alone.

The first time I failed because the walky talky used had very poor audio and got the wrong side by mistake.
The second time I drove fastly enough to not create traffic blockage, gave priority to who had it, always use the lights, evetything PERFECTLY.
Got rejected anyway because at the last point I surpassed a vehicle stuck even by remaining on my line like you CAN DO.
The problem? That road had indications to go straight if on the right and left if on the left, which I have both not seen when ordered at the last second and due to the helmet.

Other people drived very slow even without good capabilites but passed anyway for some reasons.
That day I knew I had to kill myself and just destroyed everything after failing to hang myself.

I'm not an emotive person even being really sensible so I don't usually feel anything, but at that time frustration have been tough to bear.


I don't even remember the last time I have been able to cry or feel touched.
I couldn't cry even after watching ""The Wind Rises"" and ""Graveyard of the Fireflies"" at my cinema, feeling just depressed and hurting feeling inside weighting everytime more.
I tried to also find anygirl who would watch the first movie withe me out of desperation, since the cute girl of the last institute wasn't there anymore.


I will just try to work on my projects for the three months remaining, maybe get laid and just finish myself at 18... I'm still trying to see if I will either hang myself, get euthanasia, by gun after getting weapons license or either drink a mix of poisonous and sedative herbs, having been interested in Herbalism for years as well.


It's over and I should just submit to such fate.
I just keep spending my days sleeping, jerking off, trying to study, struggling to eat or wash myself (Since I also have until now been stubborned to train myself before every shower even if I was weak) and farely mostly just beating myself up and only wishing ""If I only could turn 16 again""...



Only a miracle could save me, even not being this what I've fought for... But even talking about miracles wouldn't change, since everyday in which I wake up feels like a nightmare anyway.

Even the only real acquaintance I know since six years is slowly decaying; He's been always an introvert like me but when we've seen each other after years on skype and youtube far away from each other I tried to teach him and make him see what opportunities he had, even being myself in a difficult situation.
He eventually got a girlfriend this year and I was ""happy"" for him even being a little jealous, sinec he's one year younger as well...
Too bad these days he seems to be getting more and more destroyed as the personality he mantained, discolourating his hair, piercing his lips, eyelobs like it was for someone... This is just really bad and most likely will have to talk with him before leaving this world.

Also I never had any friend in life.
As well as the fact for which I consider the bride to be the only woman tho whom mix and become one, considering the wife as  the real ""right arm"" and helper of every man, I believe a person who you might call freind is just one in the entire world, the one who you never have complains about, having the utmost loyalthy about each other, faith and who would sacrifice for you like you would for him/her.

That's why the far I got have been contacts or acquaintances.

I will never have a wife;
I will never finish a single project;
I will never live in a countryside house and have a family;
I will never be able to mature advanced studies like medicine or engineering;
I will never be able to redeem the Nation for which I'd die for from noawady's dacaying society;
I will never be able to write anything of what I had projected;
I will never travel and know people;
I will never get strong and able to fight like never got to, to also defend a family;
I will never feel satisfaction from my sacrifice;
I will never get my wasted youth back and get to do the most part of all this at 18;

I know for many sounds just stupid either to lost virginity before a certain age or to marry at 18, but I wanted both to LIVE all this during the very fresh period of my youth, showing that life is too short to just live in laziness and that MANY people would suffer from such laziness and parasitism.
I'd liked to have a girl my age or two years younger with whom projecting life and projects during youth and I would have to now wait until 20 to redeem all that wasted time.
Sensations are different, strenght is different, the way opportunities come changes and everything is done right ahead like it should, that's why it would've been perfect to get at least to learn Computer Science to work at home, gardening and diy to become indipendent, getting a girl to know and mature each other so I could finally live together.. There's too little time tho, I could even bear to move out at 19, but there's still too little time to redeem two years wasted.
Also the thing which weights the more and forces me to feel regret is the fact for which EVEN after losing the whole 2014 I just wasted time instad of panicking and getting to work.. That's just unacceptable.

I know regret is more wasted time, but I just had a schedule and wanted to create step by step everything until my 18th year, considering also this is not what my person have always been and even slapping myself I can't get myself in strenght, except when I'm starving and have to survive or either start to stink.
Everytime the burden starts to weight I have to sleep or else I feel in pain; I've always even done meditation and such for yers at my gym along maturing in these years the calm for which other than being an impulsive multitasking machine I could just not think about it... Too bad it is personal and everywhere I look makes me remember, as well as when sex is implied in some discussion and I feel touched as explained before.
I just can't accept to feel like this after all these years of sacrifices and work
Even phyisically I've passed from a state in which I could break rocks and train even with broken bones while doing my work to not even being able to get out of the bed and cooking for myself, having to just sit and watch as some common brats who waste time with their friends are able in gym to do five times more than me, even though in all this time I should've been able to do hundreds better.
And that's not because I want to be the best, because if you go on and read some old thread of mine about wanting to hang myself you would read how I don't even give a fuck about being remembered or else and also I should be happy if people get on top of their abilities.... Too bad I should've be leading an example on which I have been sacrificing my life, that of the Polymath and Reason, not being around with kiddos, being able to do one thing in life and being praised for it, considering I've never had any hand in life not even from the parents whom I don't even care about; I just build myself while staying in my filthy room for all this year.
I didn't have people around me or either good parents, among which maybe even only one who would teach me even a single profession to keep in life. I had nothing.

Whenever I talk to her she is always starts giggling out of nowhere and doesn’t make eye contact.

"They never asked about the knifeI go by the name gilligan ( a favorite character from a book I like ) 
Im 23 I like think that im slim fit. 
Basic work out everyday, I like to fix things that are broken say it maybe a broken electric fan ill have myself electrocuted if I need to just to fix that thing or cut my fingers reparing a broken vase. 
My latest project was a laptop that my cousin bought for around 100k pesos (ph ) took me three days the power wasnt circulating properly and not turning the damned thing on. 
After a few frustrating days of sitting fown and experimenting I finally got the thing back alive. 
It felt like I just revived a person with my hands.
 It felt good. 
I dont sleep very often. 
Having an hour of nap or two maybe 3 would be grand for me. 
Most of the time im just on my social feeds just staring at animal photos. 
That cheers me up always. 
I always have these "" thoughts "" 
Say a girl says I look handsome its always followed by a voice saying she probably needs something from me or maybe someone gives me something as a gift automatically think that now I owe him .
Trust? 
Its not in my dictionary. 
These past months just pushed that word away from me farther. 
I had a girlfriend that promised me that shed never let go. 
You know what happened. 
I had a bestfriend of 15 years
Yeah we had up and downs. 
Before then I thought those downs were already settled. 
During the last weeks of my relationship my bestfriend told my girlfriend that he loves her. 
That basically came to me as a fucking tsunami againdt a small fishing boat. 
It all came crashing down after.
She broke up with me claiming that Im in the way of her studies. 
Even tho im always been supportive in all possible ways when shes stressed about anything study related. 
I make sure Im always there when shit goes down. 
And I know I did a good job. 
I am not a happy person. 
I have these momentary mental breakdowns 
Like waves of negative thoughrs pulsates through the layers of my mind. 
I have no way of dealing with it except just being quiet and let it pass through like rain to a sunny day.
Or a mist to a mountain. 
One night we three, me my gf and my bestfriend were hanging on the rooftop of my gf's condo just chilling yalking about stuff. 
And I had a fucking meltdown. 
I didnt realize its been 2 hours and ive just been staring at a fucking plant. 
Then when I woke up I just wanted to cry. 
I was crying on the inside. 
But on the outside I just smiled and excused myself saying I felt sick and wanted to go home. 
My bestfriend responds with alright I gotta go too. 
So yeah expecting them to head their own ways. 
I went home too with proper goodbyes and apologies. 
I spent another 3 hours staring at the ceiling of my room. 
After crying myself to sleep. 
3 am. 
I went out to look for food. Theres this 24/7 place near a bus top that night commuters take. 
And there I saw the two. 
Seemed like gf was walking my bestfriend to the bus stop. 
They seemed very surprised to see me. 
I didnt even speak. 
I just walked past them and kept to myself. 
My mind was all over the place. 
I knew what was going on but I was hoping I was wrong. 
My gf kept calling me. 
Asking whats wrong and saying how rude of me to ignore them like that.
I just made up an excuse that she easily accepted then things were as if nothing happened. 
Bf started talking to gf about my "" issues "" 
At this point I just tell myself just let it fix itself. 
And me being hopefull and wishing things would be different I let go of what happened. 
But I always get reminded with the fact that they talk more often than I do with my gf. 
My bf excessively gives more gifts to my gf. 
And seems to appreciate him more often that she does to me. The thoughts they pile up. 
But always, I always find the strength to push them away after all. 
They're only ""thoughts "" or "" intrusive thoughts as my gf calls it. "" 

After work I head to a net cafe to steam off. 
I receive a text that me and my gf needs to talk. 
Then I broke down. 
The person thats been slowly building me up and the foundation of my progress is about to let me go. 
So I asked are you gonna break up with me? 
"" im sorrry. "" 
I wouldnt take it anymore. 
I lost it. I went home got a kitchen knife 
Laid on my bed I lay on my stomach elevating my chest off the bed just so the knife ( handle to the bed the blade to my chest ) fits for 2 hours I was on a death plank. 
Quiet. 
No crying. 
Just blankly staring back into my pillows while my elbows supported my weight. 
After that. 
I just found myself drink 3 sleeping pills. 
The next day I didnt get off my bed. 
I couldnt eat or drink anything. 
I had no energy. 
My throat was dry. 
My stomach was grumbling. 
This went on for a full week. 
Then I started to cut my wrists again. 
Something ive stopped doing.
The last scar I had was from 2009. 
This was when my parents were throwing ceramic plates at each other like they were trying to make them fly like ufos. 


My cousins sends me a message "" yo I need help with my thesis "" 
I felt like I have a purpose again. 
So I gave everything I had into the new project. 
I was temporarily happy. 
I forgot about the small cut on my chest. 
Which have just recently stopped bleeding. 
And the cuts on my wrist started to dry up. 
Just perfectly covered by my watch. 
I can still feel the sting of when my sweat touches the wounds. 

Ive convinced myself not to care about what happened anymore..

Thanks my cousin says for sure anytime I reply. 
After that hes graduated from college
 Congrats
We start to hang out more often. 
But no I dont feel that I have a new friend. 
Im just that guy they call if they have no choice.

They live in a nice quiet village
 
I took a long ass walk at 1 am 
I realized I can try harder to be better. 
A second chance. 
I opened myself up to new people
I met this korean dude named alaycia 
And noji. 
The other is recklessly childish and the other is slyly gay aleays hinting sexual stuff towards me. But theyre cool nonetheless.
This gal ive been following on one of my social medias.
I saw her promoting a desktop tower. 
Her smile stuck with me. 
Ever since I saw it ive always brought it with me then. 
I happen to come across a familair face on fb. 
It was her. 
"" Scarlett "" 
A few days was the length of my wait to finally message her and cope up the bravery to start a conversation with. 
Little to one word replies. 
This goes on for days and weeks
Ive given up. 
Shes not interested. 
But why? 
One I am a stranger.
Two who the fuck am I. 
3 I dont need to pull another soul to suffer with me. 
But I wont do anythi g to harm her. 
I want to get to know her.
If I could. 
I want to be close to her. 
Days of emptiness were broken by "" hey im sorry ive just been busy lately "" 
My heart,  you fucking have no idea. 
My heart. 
I almost had a heart attack. 
Thank you for letting me know. 
Its fine let me know when youre not busy :) I dont mind. 
Trying to be cool.
We continue to talk through the night. 
I want to hug her. 
Please care for me like you dont want to lose me.

"On Friday the 11th just after sunset I've been planning to kill myself for a little while.That has been my plan for about 2 or 3 weeks. I'm so stressed out it's hard to move. Not like I physically can't move but I mean I just don't want too because it just hurts and I feel sick. Last month there was this musician/DJ and I've been following him since like 2013 or 2014. He inspired me to make music and I had a hardcore passion for it but he died last month and that got me into thinking these dark thoughts. He accomplished so much this guy and his music inspired millions but it all seems like it was for nothing now. I just had thought how can you enjoy life when it's so short. All this fighting to have a good life and even if you get it your just going to die soon after and who knows when you'll die. That musician was 28. He actually killed himself and when I found that out. It like erased everything I dreamed about I thought his life was so focused on music and he didn't really have too work to live he could just make music all day and not worry about paying rent and working overtime just to make that rent like I have too. So I just felt like my whole life I planned out in my head. WHICH IS REALLY HARD TO ACHIEVE... Wasn't going to make me happy if it did not make my role model happy to a point he kills himself. I just don't know why I exist. Life seems so pointless. So after all of this, I just descend into the worse week ever. I've been working 60 to 70 hours a week. My boss keeps asking me too and I just don't know how to say no. Like I could write forever on that topic alone. I'm just socially awkward and I don't know how too speak up for myself. I finally reached a point where I am burned out and I can't do my school to get myself out of the situation because I'm so burned out. I was crying at work (tried not too) just because I wanted it to stop. I felt so stressed I didn't want to move and I work in a restaurant it's a fast-paced environment. It just hurt so bad! (I really disappointed co-workers today but I know they think something is wrong with me so they let it go and didn't really say anything to the boss as far as I know) Also, this week is my sisters wedding it's on the 12th actually. I love my sister. She's such a great person. She's been afraid of me not going for over a year because she knows I don't have a great relationship with certain relatives. They are bullies. They did so many disgusting things to me. I've been abused by them. 2 of them robbed me and I had a concussion from that. This is why I chose the 11th. I don't want to make a decision. I'm struggling with PTSD from one thing they did to me and I'm just experiencing so much stress from flashbacks and whatnot knowing the wedding is so close. I can't say no though my sister... I guess killing myself is kind of worse... Seeing them would just be tremendously stressful... I just have no dreams anymore I'm depressed and I was trying to work that out and I wrote out every dark feeling I had and tried understanding it. I have a therapist and we're working on the PTSD and have been for a while now. I never admitted I wanted to kill myself. Really hard to bring that up for some reason. 


Now that the date I planned on is so close. It sort of felt relieving because it gets closer and closer. Feels like the pain is over and I go the place I inevitably will go anyways no matter how long I live, but I don't know what its like so I'm scared now and I really wish I could talk to someone but I won't admit I've been having these thoughts a lot longer before Avicii died. People know I'm pathetic anyways. I mean I'm writing on the fucking internet anonymously about how I want to kill myself. Not the first time either. I think it'll be the last time whether or not I kill myself. I might just hurt myself. Because its probably going to be too hard. ",suicidal,high

"19M, I don't want to die, but I can't find the motivation to change and can't find happinessSo, right now, I've decided suicide is my best option.

About a month ago, I broke up with my girlfriend. Simple thing right, everyone goes through breakups, even I've been through ones before her and came out alright.

No. Not this time. Throughout this last month of reflection and trying to understand, I've learned I most likely have Dependent Personality Disorder, which is why I can't let her go amongst other reasons. I honestly feel like, right now as I'm typing this, the answers I'm going to get aren't going to help me, or they'll be the same answers I've gotten before. Imagine your dream girl in every single way, from head to toe appearance wise, down to her accent, the way she did things, her hobbies that she spends with you. I had that. Now also imagine they give you a sort of love you needed all your life, but didn't realize it until it was over. It was a very motherly, pampering kind of love. I had that. My ex was a combination of incredibly specific and rare things, she is truly one of a kind. The reason I'm telling you about her is because, aside from losing my dependent, it takes away from one of the things I wanted to try to live for: love. I am very convinced I will never find someone who will make me as happy ever again, even as young as I am. Nobody seems to understand how ideal she was for me, and how unique and rare someone like that is. She cut all communication, which is fair considering how it ended and how I was, but I am tortured every single day of unanswered questions about the relationship, not knowing how she feels and worrying about her, and constantly, constantly hoping and wondering and latching on to anything related to her talking to me again. I have tried to talk to new people, but every time I compare them to her and expect things from them she would do. I even asked someone I talked to last night if they could hug me and tell me everything is okay like she used to.

I examined myself a lot, asked places (I asked here awhile ago), and talked to people to learn about myself and my problems and where to go from here. I have what I need to get better and change, and for a little while my motivation was to be a great boyfriend and hopefully husband to another girl, now that I know my problems. I've just been lying to myself, I can't even accept anyone new anymore because I only want my ex, I obsess over her all the time. I wanted to get professional help to find out more about myself and really get better, but my parents do not support it, my mother got angry at me earlier for being depressed and not eating dinner with the family and not looking for a new job. I would like to get a new job, to maybe fund the therapy myself, but I don't want the money from it, and I feel like if I wanted to get therapy my parents would continue to be unsupportive of me. I'm at a point where I doubt it would help me either.

My only solutions feel like my ex talking to me again, or finding a new hope in life. I have not been happy since she left. I've noticed that I have never really found happiness on my own, I always place my happiness in others, and even if they hurt me and are toxic I'll forgive them or want to be with them just because they make me happy and comfortable. I've blamed myself for everything that happened in the relationship, and I still feel like thats right, because she made me so happy all the time, she never really did anything wrong, and everyone around me save for some people have told me yes, I am to blame. I wasn't this bad off until a day ago, where I learned a friend shes talked to every day since it happens thinks I should have killed myself when I was suicidal before. After we broke up she told me I deserve to die, and I feel like if someone she talks to thinks that way, then she must really think that way, it wasn't out of anger. I'll say again I have not spoken to her for over a month, I don't know anything, its things like this that are all I get to have any clue about how she feels about any of this. She hasn't made any attempts to contact me whatsoever since the breakup, but that could be for an infinite amount of reasons, I constantly have thoughts like that on my mind and it has degraded me to this point.

As far as a new hope in life goes...I barely enjoy anything anymore. I shared all of my hobbies with my ex, so approaching them again is just painful. I have picked up a new one and surrounded myself with new people, but most days I can't find the motivation to continue or get better or enjoy their new company. My happiness left with my ex, and she doesn't care about me anymore as far as I know. I shouldn't care about her either because of that, right? Haha, if only it was that easy. I should hate her and find reasons to resent her to get over her, right? Unfortunately, I can't hate her, or anyone thats ever made me happy, solely because of that. I'm to blame for everything anyway. The tiniest things remind me of her, even the pet name she had for me which I adored so much makes me feel horrible. It was puppy, and I tear up even typing it out. It meant so much to me, to be her puppy. 

I don't know what to do or where to go. I can't find it in myself to do anything, and I'm not sure about getting professional help. I'm not even sure I want to help myself, all I've ever wanted this entire time was to be with her again, and treat her right now that I know my problems, I want to be the guy she wanted. She motivated me to do everything, to get my first job, she'd wake me up for work even though it was at 4am with kisses. I can't be digging into these memories like this. I feel like the only way I can atone is by dying, she thinks I should anyway, and who knows who else she talks to does. I lost a lot of friends through this, by pushing them away, or by them siding with her. I still have many friends who have supported and showed serious concern for me, but they don't make me happy, I don't depend on them, they're just there. The times they helped me they really did help me, but I've only ever felt better for a moment. I write journals all the time about my feelings, and it just goes back and forth all the time. I'm back at suicide again. Every time I get some text, or a friend request somewhere, I get a panic attack thinking its her. I can't distract myself at all, even with new things. My parents don't really take me seriously, in the end my mom is just forcing things on me because they worked for her. Come eat dinner with the family, that does nothing for me, I've always felt detached from my family. Get a job, that does nothing for me, money doesn't make me happy at all. I don't know why she got so angry at me, she started calling my ex things, I don't get her behavior, I can't tell if she wants to help me or is just doing this because if I'm depressed it makes her look bad or something.

tl;dr? I'm fucking hopeless.

"I've gotten rid of my ability to loveLong story short, from years, starting at age 12 of benzo, extremely cardiotoxic amphetamine/mdma like drug research chemical that I took over 2000 times in 3 years, unbeknownst to me it was proven to be neurotoxic and cardiotoxic about right when I stopped taking it. It was 3 times a week, 3 doses each session for 2 something years. After quitting, I can do any drug, speed, coke, oxycontin, or even be sober and I can't feel love. or anger. or anything really. even anxiolytics, weed, don't do anything. EVEN ANTIPSYCHOTIC MAJOR TRANQUILIZERS don't do anything. I had anhedonia to being with but now my brain is totaled.

There's no point living because this isn't a life. I also overdosed on phenibut 40g in june taken with dxm which was an eye opener and the next day I had an epiphany, about life just being life and human beings not being cynical but caring but that glow only lasted a month or whatever. I don't know if phenibut would help, probably would considering its a nootropic, but im on fuckton of pharms that dont do their jobs. lamictal for bipolar, buspar for anxiety, clonidine for anxiety, lexapro for depression and focalin for adhd. Even focalin, which ALWAYS got me out of a rut causes no mental effects anymore , only adrenaline heart anxiety side effects

and Iv'e tried not overthinking, and going without drugs, and NA and CBT, all bullshit therapy.

I still have my intelligence but without ANY feeling at all life isnt even bad. its just a burden. Time wasted. I don't want to kill myself because honestly I'm so indifferent to life its too much effort to bother to end it.
I just don't care. I used to be afraid of having heart attacks because i have inherant heart problems but honestly, heart murmurs, seizure auras, I don't care. I dont want it to kill me im just like, ok. brain damage, thats coo. death, thats fine. not fine, just, death is death. life is just time to waste

"Lost and looking for somethingTL:DR  
Childhood abuse paved way for messy future, stuck hopelessly floating the stormy sea of ""fml""

&amp;#x200B;

Over the years (Currently 25) I've been dealing with severe childhood trauma. To the point where I suppressed memories and felt like I was in a ghost shell. I couldn't really memorize things, math/science/schooling was difficult due to that. My family just assumed I was the dope out of my three siblings. I was never given much attention in regards to falling behind..I used to harm myself, and so far I've avoided those habits. Even old ways of venting seem useless. I even lost joy in being mean to myself.

After my grandfather passed away the summer before my 24th birthday.. Huge chunks of my childhood started flooding back. I still have nightmares about it. The more I remember the more crazy and messed up I feel.

I DO love myself, it's still hard for me to rationalize how and why this happened to me.

I feel like a burden to the few friends and family I can talk to about this..I know people say therapy helps, but I'm terrified of telling all of this to anyone. It's getting to the point where I feel  like I'm living a lie, because I don't feel like people even know who I am, or what I'm going through daily.

I've reached out to loved ones before, when I've been at my worst and thought I had schizophrenia-my family mostly treated me like I didn't know what I was talking about. Disregarded my request for help..Later my dad pulled me aside and said if I was serious, he'd help me..That was nice, but all in all, It was discouraging. 

I'm at a point where I've felt suicidal for the majority of my life, even before I learned what the word meant.. I'm tired. Exhausted. Life is losing luster. My relationship has been unhealthy with my boyfriend for a time now, I'm desperately trying to mend or repair the few things in my life that I CAN control. I know suicide is something a lot of people feel is selfish but, if my quality of life is this miserable why would someone blame me?

Am I supposed to endure suffering, continuously, so others around me don't feel inconvenienced by my death?

Idk man, it's a big cluster mess. I need help, I don't know who to turn to anymore or what else to do. Nothing seems to work. I don't want to keep going alone, but idk who out there is willing to seriously help me. If I keep getting moved aside or if people keep giving up on me.. I fear I'll give in. I want to love life, I want to feel the shine people say I bring them.. If I'm a lighthouse where's my warmth going? If not to me? 

Again, anything anyone thinks might be useful-would be great. Sorry for the mess of words. I don't know what to say really.",suicidal,high

"Learning to make games during quarantine (tips and tricks for new devs) Day 1 If you didnt see yesturday's post go check it out!

So today i finally had unity downloaded... it was time to figure it out... i started messing with it doing random stuff and seeing how it worked... but I knew i wasnt gonna be able to do anything cool without some way to learn how to use the engine...

This was easy... I just went on youtube... and found a beginner series from someone called Brackeys... and learn the basics ig (he disnt explain very well... just showed you how to do stuff)... and i was going along part by part making a game where you are a cube trying to dodge obstacles... well i spent about 10 minutes untill I had a problem...

Whenever I tried to open script editor (where you write the code) it would open adobe pdf reader (I wanted to open visual studios... of which i downloaded with the unity download) so I asked people on the Unity subreddit asking what was going on, and they told me a solution... go to preferences and switch default script editor to vs(visual studios)... but then, I yet again ran into another problem...

When i tried to select it as default it made me select it in my files... and I searched eveywhere (I mean everywhere) and couldn't find it... so I had to look up what was going on... and there was one page online of someone saying they had the same prob... they said they fixed it by redownloading visual studios... which after 2 hrs (slow internet) finally was redownloaded... AND IT WORKED!

So now that everything was working, I went back to the youtube tutorial and followed along... and this went well for about a hour and a half... but then... you guessed it... I had another problem on my hands...

The code that he was using was old and previously replaced by new functions and stuff in the newer version i have... long story short, the code in his video wasnt working for me... so I ditched that series and the project i had spent all my time on so far, and found a new series...

I didnt end up finding a new series, but instead a 2 and a half hour long video explaining all the basics (explained everything in depth and very well) I worked on that for about another hour, and finally learned a good amount.

Obviously i didnt finish a 2 1/2 hour long vid in a hour... but it was midnight and time for me to go to bed...

This was all yesturday(thursday) because i want to be one day ahead of what i write, this way I know everything I did on the day im writing about...

Im having lots of fun learning about game development and would recommend to anyone who has a okay pc and is interested in this kind of stuff to start learning as well... it helps keep you busy during your days in quarantine

So a few years ago I used to know this girl who was a pretty good friend of mine. I never really liked her in a ""crush"" kind of way mostly because I didn't think she would like me. But I do know she liked me. My friend who also knew her pretty well told me that she said she really liked me. (This is the first time I've figured out a girl had a crush on me) So I remember being pretty stoked. This got me a little interested in her. (Now that I think about it I should have asked for her number but I'm a pretty reserved dude when it comes to things like that.) The year was coming to a close and I figured out I had to change school. This actually didn't bother me that much, even after figuring out about how much that girl liked me. After I changed school over the next few years I kinda forgot about her. But then the dream I had recently comes in.

Dream: I was at a new school I was moved to and I ended up having that girl in one of my classes. She instantly recognized me and I recognized her. We ended up catching up about a lot of things that have happened in our lives. It was one of the most amazing and fun conversations I've had. (Of course it was in a dream) She and I were having a great time and she was laughing a lot. She had a very distinct laugh that was extremely contagious. So hearing it was a very nice to hear after all this time. Then the bell rang and we had to go home. That's when I woke up.

"I feel guiltyThis is probably going to be a bit long, and scattered. I feel like I cannot get my ""deep"" feelings out and don't ever talk about them with people anyway, besides Reddit apparently. I'm going to regret posting this later. 

Right now I am going to a different school far away from the one I once went to. This school is a Cambridge school but it is in the middle of no where. I am 15 so I have just come out of middle school. Middle school was truly awful but going to that Cambridge school does not make anything better. 

In middle school I was bullied a lot, shit I have been for my whole life. After coming here I wasn't expecting much but everything seems to just be another great big shit-stain. There are people there who cause drama, and even though it is petty it just makes me feel hopeless after everything. Yeah, and I get that I'm young and it is high school, maybe it is me just being a angsty teenager but I cannot help but feel hopeless. And not just hopeless in the sense that I'm a failure but in the sense that I really don't want to do anything with my life. 

To me it feels like life is not real. There is no reality but maybe it is just a dream, this is what I hope for anyway. I get detached and that is where most of my troubles begin. I made all of these dark jokes because of that detachment with my friend who I've known since preschool (now no longer with me because I moved. But also I always considered him my best friend but he had plenty of friends, I had none.) I feel guilty for these jokes but I also like them. I feel guilty for everything I have ever done. I have done some straight up embarrassing things (especially in middle school) and oh god, do those memories make me cringe. They make me want to die, literally. I think back on everything and realize it was my own demise. I feel guilty because I am privileged to even be sitting in front of a computer and breaking down while typing. Many people have had it much worse and they can actually get through things fine, I'm a selfish piece of shit.

I don't know what I want from life. I hate myself so much and I've done so many stupid fucking things. I don't think I can change my life. I am scared to get help because the last time I got help I got Baker Acted. My backpack was searched and I had drawn some troublesome things in order to cope with the bullying and school resources officers instigated me. They turned everything from me going to my school counselor for talk about suicide into, ""am I going to do something really horrible to others?"" I understand they were doing their job, but the way the school resource officers attitude towards me changed after seeing those drawings unnerved the shit out of me. Now this incident made my loving mom worried about what was happening at my middle school so that she is now making me go to this Cambridge school. Though I am going back next year to where I once lived and am going to the high school. Some people will know me from middle school. 

I don't know why I should stay alive. I like drawing and writing but every concept I come up for a drawing or writing is terrible and ""edgy"". I can't do anything right. Right now I am failing math. I don't belong at this school. 

Maybe I need a friend who can truly understand, someone I could talk to for hours and actually talk to out of school. Maybe I just need to act like a completely different person. Maybe I need advice. I don't know what could keep me alive. I don't deserve to be alive.

"I don't know what to doTo preface all of this, I've struggled with ADHD, OCD, and MDD my whole life. I never had structure of guidance on how to manage myself and follow through. I feel like I've faked my way through everything, and when I do try to seriously put effort in, I end up spinning my wheels and often failing worse. I'm currently going to a very expensive college, and I feel like I don't deserve to be there. I don't feel smart enough or capable enough, and I've been really struggling since I got here, and I'm in my senior year now and nothing is better and I can't do anything and none of my professors believe in me anymore and they all look at me like they don't want me to be there or like I'm an annoyance. They treat me as if I'm unreliable, which makes me panic and spiral and then I AM unreliable and I make everything worse. I feel like all the negative things people say about me are true. I feel like I can't do anything right. I've tried really hard to get better, but nothing ever sticks. I've been in therapy and taken medications and gotten an ADHD coach and I still can't do anything for myself. When I was barely scraping by and passing my classes I tried to push through, but now I've failed two classes and I just don't know if I have it in me to try again.  I know failing isn't horrible, but it proved to me that I haven't improved at all and that I am totally and completely hopeless. I failed the same class twice after the professors bent over backwards to help me and the class wasn't even difficult to begin with. If I fail again I'm going to be kicked out, and I feel so guilty that my parents have wasted money on my education and trying to get me help when I'm just a helpless idiot who can't do anything. I know people let care about me, and I know it will hurt them, but I don't know how I'm going to ever be able to function on my own and I don't want my parents or friends to waste any more time or money or effort on me when everything up until this point hasn't worked. I just feel so guilty and I hate myself for messing up so badly when all my parents have done is support me and try to give me the opportunity to succeed. I wish I could just flip a switch and have it all be over, but I know that if I tried to kill myself I'd just fuck that up too and then make even more problems for my family and cost them even more money. Im terrified how they'll react when they find out I've failed. I'm terrified of going back to school. I'm terrified of the future. I really don't know what to do.

"Hard times.....So I have an interesting story.... Bear(bare?) With me, if you will. If not oh well, good luck and god bless. 

I'm really having an extremely hard time dealing with my anxiety/depression/intrusive thoughts. 

Roughly a month or two ago, I started getting really depressed and anxious. I constantly thought(think) that my S/O is or has cheated on me. It's like little movies that play in my head that show what my mind thinks she's doing. It seems extremely real and graphic. It also happens when I'm asleep, I dream the same vivid/graphic thoughts. 

She gives me NO reason to question her. She leaves her phone open, offers to let me look through it, is constantly telling me she loves me. We are together every minute that we aren't at work. We're getting a place together and so forth. Both of us are extremely mature and have fantastic careers. When I say she gives me no reason, she gives me no reason. She knows all about these issues and sticks by me and supports me. 

I have a counselor and I'm on some meds that aren't working. 

I have had past traumatic relationships: ex killed herself, others cheated on me constantly, ex-wife was physically,mentally and emotionally abusive. 

Anyway,

When I get in this mindset, I really want it to stop and contemplate suicide, to the point of having a plan constructed and note written.... I just need some advice or something.... And I can't really tell too many people because they'd call 911 and well, I'm part of 911.",suicidal,high

&amp;#x200B;

I was assaulted by my babysitter when I was 7. The babysitter was 13. The whole thing is so fucked that my brain has twisted it into an awful nightmare of a memory, and the only reason I know it's real is because my sister remembers seeing it.

Growing up, my dad has horrible rage problems. He used to grab my face so hard between his fingers that the insides of my cheeks would bleed. He ran me out of the house once and I was so frantic and scared that I broke my ankle. I spent one New Year's Eve walking along the road without a coat or proper shoes because he kicked me out in a rage. I lived in my car for two week because I refused to have an argument with him and it made him so angry that he threatened to divorce my mother if I didn't leave. But then, sometimes, he was my best friend. Sometimes, I was his favorite. Sometimes he still is my best friend now. And sometimes he's an asshole.

Any my mother uses me as her emotional crutch, but is never \*really\* there for me. Same with my sister. Fortunately my brother is great. I stay alive for him mostly, and my best friend who is also great. But. It's getting hard. There's too many things.

A highschool teacher and I had a highly inappropriate relationship. I was also sexually assaulted twice in high school. Once very violently at a youth church group. One violently and publicly at school.

My first college boyfriend was horribly abusive - emotionally and physical. I have trouble swallowing and breathing sometimes because he permanently damaged my hyoid. 

All of the lovers I kept after my first relationship abused me, or I was a fucking piece of shit abuser to them. Or both. There were two where it was mutually destructive and awful and abusive and just pure usery. There was one...One that legitimately raped me. I still bear physical and mental trauma from that rape.

My second long term relationship was just as emotionally abusive as my first and he constantly threatened violence. Then he stalked me after we broke up.

And everyone I've dated since has been a user or an asshole. Each one. And I was coerced into sex by one of them, again. They penetrated me without my permission and they didn't use a condom. I didn't say no. But I also froze and full on dissociated. I would've been fine with sex if they would've asked for a condom, or maybe asked for vocal consent. But, they were literally on top of me and had a foot in height and easily 50-70 lbs of weight on me and I just froze. And they fucking gave me HPV. And now I have precancer. 

I'm sick, too. I have fibromyalgia. I was diagnosed when I was 10. No one understands it (besides doctors, and even then some doctors are dicks about it). The prevailing theory currently is that it's a mutation of mitochondrial DNA that leaves the mitochondria more vulnerable to oxidative stress. My cells can't process energy properly. So I'm tired all the time, and it feels like I've pulled every muscle in my body, on top of shooting nerve pain, migraines, and a stomach that is never not hurting. I don't sleep, because I'm in so much pain. My body is fucked on the cellular level. And there's nothing anyone can do about it. And I can't afford my medicine because I $2000 in the hole for an emergency surgery that my cat had to have.

I want to die. Or sleep for a very long time. Until I can wake up and be someone else. Maybe I did something horrible in a past life. My life is not pure shit. Sometimes it's good. Sometimes I love to live life. I love nature. I love drawing. I love science. I love magic and music and art. So many things. But I am constantly hurt by people. Destroyed by people. All I want is to love. I do love. I am such an amazing friend. I am. I would do anything for anyone. But people see that weakness and take advantage of it and they crush me and destroy me and tear me to pieces over and over and over again. There is so little left of me now. 

I do things for myself, or try to anyhow. Things to comfort myself. I've been through therapy so many times. I can't do it right now. So, I just try to love myself. But, it's hard when it feels like I'm the only person that loves me. I have one person in my life who I'm sure loves me unconditionally, but I cannot burden them. They take on everyone else's pain all the time. I really stay alive for them, because even worse things have happened to them, and I don't want to be one more awful tragedy or loss in their life. But, still. They're like the sibling I always wanted. And I am horribly lonely and want and need a different kind of love. But, every time I've tried...I've been shredded. Over and over. 

There is so so so little left. So little left of me. I really do not know how much more there is until I am nothing and have to completely rebuild myself.

"Posting evil facts about historical figures you love until I stop being a cynical asshole day 19: Thomas Edison I mean, we all know Edison didn't invent the lightbulb, but he did play his part on the team. He still took full credit anyways.

Some other things he took credit for were movie cameras, X-rays, record players, power generators and wax paper when he had little to nothing to do with any of them.

In fact, he used to have associates travel around the country, possibly the world, and find young scientists working on things. They would then be invited by the great Thomas Edison and present their inventions for a patent. Then, the Great Thomas Edison would present his ""own inventions"" and patent them.

There is one thing he invented, though. He was in a feud with a rival electric company. Edison advocated the use of direct current and his rival advocated for alternating current. They each had pros and cons. At the time, they didn't know how to get alternating current to power anything while direct current could, but at the same time, every house and factory would have to come with their own generator in direct current.

Edison thought that he had found the tie-breaker. If you touch a wire with direct current, the electricity stays in the wire, thus completely safe. However, alternating current, he believed, could kill you. To undermine his competitor, he said that the only thing that alternating current was good for was a ""quick and humane method of death."" 

He purchased many animals of many sizes, like a monkey, a horse, a dog, and even an elephant. Edison then hooked them up to wires made by his rival to the animals and electrocuted them to death. He claimed they died painlessly, so he designed a chair to execute people on death row.

Around that time, a man confessed to killing his wife. He was sentenced to Edison's chair. He obviously never lived to tell us, but the doctors believed that the agony and pain he felt was beyond our imaginations.

Her family is going through a lot, since her mom is suffering from post Covid-19 mental breakdown issues and both her parents are in the hospital for the same. I live in India, and both my parents are totally disinterested in sending me to her house, and my dad recently had an war of words with hers, blaming her family and accusing them of spoiling me. 

At present, I tried to call her down via text, she doesn't want me to come to her house. She is alone with her grandmother, she tells she is going to kill herself lock all doors, and kill herself at the first moment she realises that I have come to her house. I don't know what to do. Please help me! I am begging you all",suicidal,high

"I'm happy and excited about my plan.Theres no where else I can really post this on reddit I think, but I really just need to tell someone about this. It's weird, but I'm actually excited about killing myself. I have a plan for this Saturday, when a parcel arrives which is going to help me. I'm a broken person at this point, I've attempted before and a whim, and have recieved ""help"" but that hasn't worked and now at this point, I am unwilling to help myself anymore. My self harm stopped working at suppressing the thoughts, I don't know why I'm still doing it at this point, I think it's to keep me focused on the end goal now, stop things from breaking down before the event. I've done my research this time, and have bought all the appropriate stuff. All I can do is wait and carefully avoid anything that will give me second thoughts, and plunge in to stuff that will send me down further. Once I'm dead I won't be alive to give a shit anymore:)))",suicidal,high

"Not sure what to thinkI never thought that I would be submitting such a post but here we are. Long story short, My wife and I will be getting a divorce and we have 2 little kids. One infant, 6 months old, and one 5 year old. I love both of my kids dearly. More than myself even. I made a bad call on a certain topic and my wants to file for divorce. 

The thing is I don’t want to live without them. I don’t even know how I can! The idea of them growing up between 2 houses, going back and forth every week/weekend, seeing their mom getting a BF and their dad getting a GF, not being able to be there to see their milestones is killing me. I am thinking that maybe with one parent out of the picture might be easiest for them. Instead of blaming both of us for the absence of a proper family around house I wouldn’t mind taking the blame for being the “weak link” in the family who took the easy way out. 

It is easier for the moms to make such a decision as the court system tends to side with the mom when it comes to custody and don’t get me wrong I am all about the best environment for the children no matter what. Just the thought of that makes it harder for me to breathe. I have my “goodbye letter” written and hidden somewhere away. I am not worried about taking off I am worried about the idea of ‘what if I am leaving a bigger mess for mg kids to deal with?’.

"Early morning sad thoughts about people abandoning youI’m gonna admit that I’m a substance abuser. I enjoy the altered state I get when high or drunk. Currently this past year I been using Xanax from anxiety, alcohol, and weed. I even done opiates for a bit and I’m glad I never got absorbed into it physically addicted wise. Every evening after work or in general at some point I like to indulge in getting a buzz. When I’m sober I just look at how I let myself go 4 years ago,  I was youthful, naive, determined, and driven. I had beautiful girlfriends or flings then when drugs and alcohol came into the picture all that changed. Want to get to the point because so much has happened but I’m now in another real relationship we live together and it’s love... However she and I have separate life paths. Mine is basically be selfish and focus on career etc. She on the other hand needs to get a job, get back to schooling, take care of her daughter, etc. Her family loves me but now last few weeks she has been discussing or saying I do drugs and that I’m an addict. The family doesn’t explicitly say anything to me but it does hurt now that this is leading to us moving away from each other coming February we plan to end the lease of our apartment. Idk what I wanna do either quit my job I’m doing well now where I moved to be with my gf and go live with my parents and do rehab idk.. I want to change but I’m literally an addict. People say it’s a choice and in the beginning it is but then it gets to a point it’s like food you want/need it. I think to myself i got so much weight on me, I’m in a rut where I don’t like expressing my personal life to people besides my close friends or family so I been anti-social. I’m 25 now and I’m just so worried that I’m becoming something scary and I should just die before it comes to that point. I just can’t do the suicide yet because I don’t wanna hurt my parents anymore than I have with the choices I made. I mean this with everything but my parents are the reason I have yet to carry thru killing myself because I don’t want the blood on my hands of their dismay. Selfishly I have siblings but I don’t mind them taking the burden we are not close and speak rarely. People act like they are afraid of me but I always have good intentions, I never do people wrong, only time I showed my Hulk anger is when blackout drunk a few times in my life. When sober, people would never think I had that anger inside. Faith is all I got at this point that I can have hope in. The concept itself. I hate that I just feel dead inside, I hate that I have no motivation to execute my dreams, I hate what I become. It’s so hard being a male who is emotionally broken, no one desires you and no one thinks you are worth anything. If I existed on an island with only animals and me as the sole human I honestly think I find solace because I’m unique and have no one to compare myself or others compare me too. When I truly disconnect myself, phone, internet, and immerse myself into a game or hobby that is only time I’m content. I need a therapist... or program that can take me in... I need purpose... Just a sad man, with blessings to count...",suicidal,high

a few days ago i attempted suicide. I first tried to do that thing with carbon monoxide; couldnt find the keys. tried to hang myself but the fan was too flimsy, and I was gonna electrocute myself via fork and socket but i was too much of a wimp. I ended up calling my mom (i'm 16) and she helped me, but i still really want to die. my mom is on a business trip so im staying with a friend of the family (my dad is a narcissistic piece of shit), and one of the few things preventing me from taking a bath with my laptop is that i dont want their 3 y/o daughter to walk in on my dead body. 

im trans and on hormones, live in an upper middle class household, have a great girlfriend, go to a great school, and have an amazing mom. i have no addictions and life is just going better, BUT I WANT TO FUCKING DIE. I DONT DESERVE ANY OF THIS AND I JUST DONT WANT TO BE HERE ANYMORE

yes i have a therapist. she helps a lot. I still want to die.

She broke up with me yesterday and I found out that whilst I was away with work she spent the night with this other man. She was at his house and they slept in the same bed but apparently nothing happened, although it seems hard to believe two people with mutual attraction for each other would sleep in the same bed naked and do nothing.

I'm going out of my mind. I've had two hours sleep. I was crying all day yesterday and immediately when I woke up without her. I begged her not to do this but she said she doesn't feel the same anymore.

I have never felt so low. And all I can think of is her with this other guy who, at one point in the past I caught her sending flirty messages and arranging to meet up with.

"I’m scared to turn my camera on in online class due to what happened to my friend My friend is bullied at school, and our school is doing a hybrid schedule. During one of the days she was home, someone took a picture of her from the google meet and edited it into embarrassing images. It was spread all over Snapchat and Instagram. She didn't tell anyone at school, and now the bullies are free.

In all of the classes you are **required** to turn your camera on or else you’ll get marked absent. (We’re assuming that the bullies had aimed their camera at the ceiling so their phone wasn’t in view when they took the photo.) The teachers won’t listen to me telling them about my anxiety and fear of my photo being taken from the meeting.

My parents tell me not to worry and don’t get involved because it’s “not my problem”

But it is my problem:
*I’m* scared to turn *my* camera on because what if what happened to her happens to me. 

I’m mad at her for not telling anyone, mad at the bullies for doing it in the first place, mad at the insensitive teachers who bitch about how we have to keep our cameras on.",normal,low
"Need advice for what to do nextHey guys. I figured I'd give this a shot since I don't really know what to do. I've struggled with depression at varying degrees for 6-7 years now (I'm 22). I thought at some point as I got older it would be something I'd grow out of, but I haven't. I still hate myself and I still think about killing myself. 

In the past year it has gone from once a month to once a day where I have a thought about doing it. The problem is, I know I shouldn't. I don't want to. I don't want to die or to end my life. I don't want to be depressed and I don't want to feel this way. 

I'm not really worried I will kill myself, at least not tonight or something like that. I'm worried that I am broken. I can't stop hating myself and I can't stop thinking about killing myself. I don't know what to do. 

I am getting details about a therapist/psychiatrist that I could see. My parents think this is a problem in the past and if I used my family's health insurance I think they would know. I don't want them to but I don't know how much this kind of stuff costs. 

Could a college student afford therapy and potentially anti depressants?

I don't know what to do and I have no one to ask for help from. Any comments or advice would be great. Thanks in advance. ",suicidal,high

"Well well well... I'm back here againRight now I feel trapped in life.  Death is looking more and more like a solution.  Regardless of how other's feel.

I'm 37 years old, married, I work at a job that pays well, but I'm the only one working.  I have an alcoholic wife who was re-enabled by a psychobitch that used to live next door to us, after my wife almost died from Liver damage in 2018.  As it stands right now, I work for a company who just suffered the biggest IT security failure in US history, my best friend comes over with 3 days warning and when I'm practically skint broke, $4000 in credit card and pay day loan debt, trying to keep us afloat (just barely) - while my wife starts drinking again because my mom can't keep family drama and gossip to herself, yet does not have the ovaries to come to ME about any issues with me, because women believe that women have the ability to control men - nobody should be controlling anyone.

Let's start with work. My job was great, until this year, and hiring managers started throwing a fit about new hires not getting done on time.  Then COVID-19 happens, and of course that  makes the apptempts to remediate the process worse, then a short time ago, we have an outbreak of a computer virus that takes down almost the whole company and of course I'm the only guy who did not take more than a couple days off during that time - so I was effectively a one-man show for 2 weeks.  Every fucking day, I have some fucking end user breathing down my neck about when their laptop is going to be reimaged, or when some network resource is going to be up, or when I'm going to have this or that ready.  The higher ups don't seem to have a fucking clue how long anything takes and asks other branches of our org - which use completley different configurations from one another - how long it might take for something to be done and when given a shorter answer it's assumed we can do it in that same amount of time.  I have been working 60+ hours a week and my nerves are frayed, I'm tired all the time, depressed, and starting to wonder if this life is for me.

At the beginning of the year, a meth-head alcoholic lady with a kid moved in next door, and she has a rich father that buys her out of every bit of trouble she gets into.  at 3 am the first week she was in her, her ex-husband, and her biker boyfriend all had a fight outside our door, and I spent that night with amachete on the other side of our door ready to stab anything that breeches our apartment doorway (we have the castle doctrine/stand your ground laws in our state).  So this woman tries to brefriend my wife, who is a bleeding heart that tries to help everyone (except me apparently) and of course I'm now playing babysitter to my recovered wife and this crazy alcoholic cunt who can't even string two sentences together coherently unless you call the cops to her house - which happened, seven times, twice by us.  This woman got my wife drinking again, and honestly, I want the bitch dead, but it seems like since COVID-19 everyone has become some sort of drug addled alcoholic except me because I'm essential.  This bitch put my wife in the hospital - TWICe - and has given her anxiety issues.  This bitch has also given me anxiety issues now because when we tried to get help from my wife's parents - who are also rich, this drunk methhead's daddy has a best friend whose a prosecuter locally who - if charges were pressed - would do everything in his power, legally or illegally, to make me into a criminal sex offender - even though my interactions with this dumb bimbo from next door were next to none, other than me telling her ""no"" after trying to invite me into her house once - where she TRIED to pull me into the house and I shoved her away after my refusal.

So now my wife is drinking and has anxiety issues - great.  So now I have to stoop to all kinds of sneaky tactics to take her alcohol away from her.  Wait until she's drunk and then take the bottle and throw it out.  Wait until she's in the bathroom and take the bottle and throw it out.  Sniff her unattended drinks at random and dump them out if they contain Vodka (because that's what she drinks and it seems to be only what she drinks).  Dig all throughout various nooks and crannies of our apartment to find her alcohol and throw it out.

But there's not just health implications of this, there's also the financial ones.  I watch our bank account, but I can't do much about it either because she has her own cards on her own accounts as well.  I know when she buys liquor on my dime because I'll see these charges that don't match up.  Don't think for one solitary instant that a visit to the 711 for a pack of skittles and a gator ade costs $21.95.  She thinks I don't pay attention to this because my mom says I'm ""senseless"" with money...which brings me to the next fucking problem....my own family.

Both of us come from families full of aging old hags who are 65+ years old and retired.  These ladies feign technological incapability in order to spy on us via facebook then throw a fit when we don't post anything new often enough.  Her mom cares too much what other people think and therefore anything posted - or not posted - becomes a subject for scorn.  This lady also drives us nuts because were poor but were DROWNING in clothes we can't even sell because nobody is going to pay $230 for a fucking t-shirt.  We need help buying a house, instead we get more furniture, clothes, and such.  I hate to look a gift horse in the mouth, but it seems the focus of some of these financial investments are pretty badly skewed.  Who the fuck wants a Armani suit when they live in the fucking ghetto?  That's a good way to get robbed, mugged, or shot.  My mom has been a thorn in my side all my life to the point that I pretty much cut my entire family off through the majority of my 20's - never buying them gifts, never calling anyone but mom (who would call me if I did not call her).  My second oldest sister has not worked in 10 years, is a hypocrite, married to a gay man my wife's gay friend found on a gay dating app - I have no issues with gay people, what I do take issue with is this same dipshit at my fucking wedding told me he thought I was a ""weak little man"" and now somehow marriage makes me ""grown up"" in his eyes - fuck that guy.  I lived in my brother in-laws shadow for years because of his looks and education - because I did not follow his preppy rich-kid lifestyle as a poor kid with a single mom. That fag can fuck off (there are gay people, then there are fags).  My mom keps harassing my wife, whom has endometriosis (part of her drinking is also self-medication because the US Healthcare system is a total scam and joke that does antyhing BUT help people), to have kids.  I don't want kids.  Why would I want to put another soul on this earth to suffer 100X worse than I already did growing up?  Why would I subject a child to this planet - that would be like putting an eight year old in a cage with a pedophile rapist serial killer with schitzophrenia.  As much as I explain this, she does not respect our wishes - however, I make one big stink on facebook because she can't stop gossiping about my republican homophobic aunts - one who abuses her gay son (whose parrot bit her in the arm - I hope the bitch catches sepsis and dies herself), the other apparently slapped me before I was even old enough to remember and is a staunch Trump supporter, and has a niece who has a crush on me and wants to sleep with me (EWWW).  Oh, and that sister, she's a hypocrite.  She spent all my childhood correcting me on my ""grammar"" from living in the deep south, only now to be playing the part as the ""perfect southern belle"" complete with god complex and incorrect grammar.  meahwhile she has a daughter that's been pregant twice, and a son that jerks it on the front lawn - yet IM the one everyone calls a b raindead manchild?  Let's see?  Who has a working career of 20 years?  ME!  Who has a marriage that's not on the verge of divorce, or is not already divorced - ME!  Who is the one who has bettered themselvews in the last 20 years?  ME!  Yet I can't get one shred of respect from ANYONE without seeming like I'm about to potentially gun someone done or beat the shit out of them - a prospect that is both counter-productive, and exhausting.  I've tried being assertive, I've tried making amends, but I just can't get anywhere - and wherever I go, my fucked up family follows me!  Meanwhile my wife is having her own problems of the same kind with HER family.

Right now I'm fucked financially.  My work benefits fucked me up the ass.  me and the wife have both been to the hospital in the last 2 years, they said they would cover it - instead it's all gone to collections, and finance never returns my calls, but it's a reliable and better paycheck than I had working for a fortune 500 software company.  So now my credit rating is u nder 640, I'm $4000 in debt because every job my wife gets she gets sexually  harassed and any attempts at legal action just result in exposing how corrupt and messed up our country is - honestly, why can't someone assassinate Donald J. Trump and the rest of these cronies already - I' have considered a suicide bombing at one of his rallies as a potental out for me.  I'm not a staunch liberal at all - I'm non partisan, but the effects this administration is having on people are beyond toxic and while it's affecting others around me far worse I'm trying damn hard to survive all this shit and it's starting to get to me.  BTW, that's antoher thing I have to deal with the wife stressing about every damn day - politics, what Donald did today, what McConnell or Barr did tomorrow.  I'm about a hair thin wire short of p utting KID site blockers on all our devices just to keep the political crap out.  The only reason I don't do it is because it seems kind of drastic for 2 concenting grown ass adults.

And people automatically assume we are better off than we are because of social media.  We own all this nice stuff (her mom, my history of some other art things I did myself), and she takes selfies all the goddamn time because her mom demands them.  They get in a fight every damn week where I have to comfort her - but whose comforting me?  Nobody.  

Right now I'd have a good moral support for my best friend, but he's a stoner eating us out of house and home and wants to buy  me CBD.  I work in Healthcare myself - and I CANT take drugs of any  kind right now unless it's by prescription or OTC for something that's ailing me.  So what the fuck is that supposed to do, raise my anxiety level?

All I want to do right now is sleep.  I'm tired, I'm getting about 4 hours of sleep per night.  Getting to bed on time is a fight because my wife wants all this pillow talk about all the stressful shit above.  She has it easy - she's a kept woman for now - I pay all the bills, I pay all the insurance - right now I'm a WEEK LATE on everything waiting for a huge paycheck from all the OT I accrued - which I'm not sure will really be that huge.

I feel like I'm in a nightmare I can't awaken from.  I've looked up methods on various sites and have it all worked out - had it for years.  It just seems, every attempt to get into a  better life starts off getting better for a short while, and then goes to hell in a handbasket.  I just want a simple live where I'm happy, everyone else wants me to greedily go for the ""gold"" - I don't care.  I just want to be left alone, and sleep in peace until I'm either tired no more.  Maybe death is the only way.  It's not the first time, I've had a history of suicidal behavior since I  was about eight years old including drinking posion, late night suicidal driving behavior, and even once almost succeeding that resulted in me shitting foam for a day and blacking out in the bathroom.

ALL I WANT from fucking life, for the love of god (whom I no longer believe exists) - is for things just to be benign, boring, normal! Drama free! Why can't I have that?  It's so fucking simple.  Just work, pay my rent and my bills, do things I enjoy off the clock.  Things like data breeches and toxic people should be a bump in the road easily resolved by remediations or by cutting those peopel out of your life.  But what do you do when the management is inept and the peopel you want gone keep coming the fuck back?  

I might not be as unfortunate as many of the people here, but it goes to show you that no matter how good you do in life, it won't necessarily mean that it's actually good for your mental health.  I would much rather fix these issues than hit rock bottom - but sometimes I feel like I'm staring at the floor 2 inches away from my face with the last rope left around my leg that's fraying at the top of the well, noting the lack of handholds to get back up, or the few that take me 5 inches off the floor, and thinking ""just why the hell should I keep on trying?

"I am Really Hurting and I Just Needed to Say ThisI am not going to kill myself but I am really, really hurting and I just wanted a place to type this.  I am in my mid-forties and am a guy and am a virgin but no I'm not one of those insane ""incel"" people.  I got the shit beat out of me as a kid repeatedly.  Not by my parents but by bullies.  My parents both grew up in situations that didn't show them how to calm themselves down from being scared or being angry, and my dad had unemployment issues throughout most of his life.  Because they didn't know how to self-soothe and because they didn't know that they didn't know, it's not something I ever picked up.  So I ate.

And because of all of the bullying and then later just polite exclusion, I grew up even to nowadays thinking that I am just absolute shit.  I'm not suicidal because frankly I don't want to hurt people who know me and I am pretty sure that we just wink out like a candle, and I don't want that to happen to me yet.  But a pseudo-friend of mine got married this weekend and although I am very happy for him it is really hard to see the love in their eyes.  To see her hold him.  I don't love her specifically or anything, I just want THAT.  I just want someone to hold me in their arms and to know that they love me and that I am worth being loved.

And I'm not.  I'm absolute fucking trash.  I'm a fat fucking bastard and even if I lose the weight I'll look like a fucking sharpei.  And even if I was skinny I'd still be shit.  It doesn't matter what I do in my life or whether I'm nice or kind or whatever, it doesn't matter whatever I do, it seems to be that I'm absolute fucking trash and that everything in the world has to be a fucking uphill Sisphyean slog just based on survival, so why shouldn't I enjoy a fucking pizza?

It'd be nice if we knew for a fact that we reincarnate.  I wouldn't mind spinning the cosmic slot machine again.  And I don't know if this even belongs here because I am definitely not killing myself.  And yes I'm in therapy, I'm even in trauma therapy, but I just needed to say this here.  Please don't freak out if I don't respond, I won't be dead, and I'm firmly expecting no one to answer this and for it to get downvoted to zero anyway, but I just had to write this here for once.  I just ... I thought that if I got through the bullying that one day it would stop and I would have a good life.  They kept saying ""it gets better.""  And sometimes it doesn't and everything just continues being fucking hell.  And sometimes you fight the fight every day and sometimes you just get so many blows in one day that it's hard to stand up anymore.",suicidal,high

"I just don't know what to do.Hey. I've been struggling with high functioning depression and anxiety for almost two years. I don't know how it started but I'm guessing it's my parents. They constantly fight and my dad has extreme OCD and ADD. He refuses to go to a doctor or get any medication... And takes it out everyone else in the house.

I know they love each other but sometimes I just can't. My dad constantly tells me how much of a disappointment I am and how I do nothing right. My mom is better, but the same. I feel if I told them about what I'm going through, they wouldn't believe me because I'm not traditionally depressed. They would probably tell me other people have it worse and I need to suck it up.

As with many people, some days are better than others. Days I'm out with friends or doing stuff I enjoy are better, but as soon as I'm home or the smallest thing happens I just want to curl up in a ball. And the things I enjoy (painting, horseback riding, gaming, and sound engineering) my parents disapprove of or make fun of me about. My favorite thing is my job. I work/intern as an audio engineer doing church services, high school graduations, etcetera. I feel like my boss cares about me more than my family.

My parents are Christian but I'm a deist. I can't tell them. Things would be different and I can't lose my best friends. I feel out of place at church, and even talking to my youth pastor he was not nice to me about my lack of faith. I have the best friends ever who know nothing of this. My family acts so perfect and seems so perfect from the outside.

The only reason I havn't ended it all is I don't want to put my family and friends through it. I just can't take it anymore. I'm only a freshman and I have no hope for the future. Maybe it's time to think about myself and be done. Sorry for the rant.

tl;dr: I'm a high functioning depressive who can't deal.",suicidal,high

I joined here back around 2014 on my old Reddit account and have been subscribed ever since. Never been super active here, but I lurked a lot. It’s really weird to know I’m not a teenager anymore.

I don’t have much advice, but I will say this: enjoy these years as much as possible. Try not to sweat about dumb stuff, you only really remember the good times in the end. School blows sometimes but for most it is time with your friends, and (unless you had a terrible experience) you will look back on it positively. 

Also, don’t take from granted all the time you have. It may not seem like it, but in high school you really have a lot of time to do whatever you like without the pressure of responsibilities you’ll have down the line. Don’t worry too much about using this time wisely, just have fun right now.

"Failing as a student. Caught up in too many liesRight now I should be writing for a group assignment. I, a socially anxious expert in underachieving, together with an individualist, and someone who I'd call an unimaginably ignorant idiot who shouldn't be in the humanities, but am too fond of. It's only supposed to be a revision of a paper that was due January, but we got a fail mark back then. The final paper was like three papers sewn together, with an introduction and conclusion for an entirily different one. So we have to rewrite it now, and 2500 words remain to be written by me. It's due Monday. Procrastination's a bitch. I can't seem to force myself into writing though, my head hurts when I try to focus myself on the assignment. Turns out this 'revision'-in-progress might turn out to be a worse disaster from a more general perspective. It's a lost cause.

It's not the first time that this happens, I failed 7 of my courses this year, 6 of which I'll have to retake next year, all but one because of written assignments. I just can't get myself to work when I'm at home. I always fall into a suicidal line of thought - because somehow my brain thinks death is more comfortable than working on a lost cause, at least until I finally decide to *bail the fuck out*. 

But that's the thing: I can't bail the fuck out on this thing. I promised that I would work on this, so they can at least graduate (if this paper is miraculously given a pass grade). They believe I'm hard at work, while I'm actually lurking SW and related subreddits. Also, if I bail out, I'll have to retake this course next year and will thus be forced into a group assignment with my new classmates. Sadly, the groups are mostly formed before the assignment is even gives, due to small friend groups. I would be alone and not dare to speak to the lecturer about it because of the extreme shame. It's like high school all over again. 

The third reason why I can't bail out, is because my parents will 'kill me' if I do. They already know that I'll have to retake some courses after opening up to them about my depression and social anxiety, but they don't know I pretty much failed the entire year. Then there's my grandmother, who doesn't know any of this and thinks I'm right on track.

The truth is that I'm here, caught in the middle between choosing to force myself into working and throwing away only one year, and bailing out of this paper, throwing away two years or even more if I ultimately decide to bail out on everything.

Sorry for the rambling. I'll just leave it here, since I'd probably end up deleting the entirity of this post if I even begin to revise or add things to it. I wouldn't be able to finish it.

Edit: Did I mention that I'm always ashamed if I post something? Even the anonymity of a throwaway doesn't seem to protect me from these feelings. 

Edit 2: Sent the lecturer an e-mail, explaining that I'm dropping out from this course. That didn't take long. Now my colleagues, no way back now.",suicidal,high

I attempted suicideI obviously failed and that bullshit about suicidal people feeling horrible and wanting to live and realizing it is a mistake isn’t true I felt free and liberated.

"I don't want to want to die anymore.I've been trying so hard to reach out to my friends because I feel so close to suicide, and when they keep posting this shit about ""Oh call this number, call me"" bull shit, but they won't respond to me. I just don't know what to do. I'm trying so hard to hold onto the hope that this will get better, that I won't be like this forever but I'm so sad and scared that it won't get any better. I'm so close to walking infront of a subway or opening my razors and just trying to die. 

My depression has done such a good job of isolating me that the people I'd normally talk to are mad at me because i've blown up at them because of how desperate and lonely I feel. It's been a month of wanting to kill myself and trying so hard not to. I see that they're on line and i know they don't want to hear from me because of the monster I become when I'm like this. 

All of them have at somepoint come to me when they've been at their lowest and I've helped them. But I can't call them now because they're so mad at me. One even said something basically being like 'you're alone because you expect people to put up with your shit"" But I don't want to die.

"I need help helping my ""sister""This girl who is the sister of an ex-gf is really close to me, so much so that I call her my sister and she calls me her big brother.  I love her very much and we talk about almost everything as far as I can tell.  For many years she has been depressed and working with doctors and therapists to try and help her and get her on meds, but they seem to either not work, or really mess with her body which makes it worse for her.  I found out maybe a month ago that she is cutting and has cut in the past.  She has come to me asking for help in the past for depression but tonight she said that she really needs help and she ""is tired of using my leg like a venting tool.""

I have been doing my best to be there for her and support and encourage her as much as possible to get her by day by day, but I feel like I keep treading water and am slowly going under in that I am not keeping up in my support for her.  I need and want to do more for her but I keep feeling lost.  I keep trying to get her to focus on the good in her life and her accomplishments, and compliment her that she is amazing, but I keep feeling like that isn't enough.  I keep feeling like that is is just helping her get by for that moment but isn't helping any in the long term.  Any advice or recommendations to support either for me to help her or her helping her self would be appreciated.

tl:dr My very close female friend who is my ""sister"" is cutting and I feel like my form of trying to help her is only small band-aid fixes.  Looking for additional support.",suicidal,high

"days just passing byi know most of people talking about killing themselves seek for attention, they won't do it, they will just talk about killing themselves so anyone will hear them out. Anytime i feel like killing myself i think like i would like to fall from some really tall building in the center of my town and i catch myself that i'm only seeking attention. 
On the other hand i see no joy in living. It was always a struggle for me to live. Only think making me happy was playing games because i didnt think about nescessity to go to school, get education, get a job. Everything new i try brings me no joy. I just got information that i will not get any points from an assignment because i copied part of my friend's work. If I didnt do that i would have a chance to pass it but i didnt know it back then. It basically make all of that even worse because i will have to probably study one more year because of this. I enjoyed my studies for first two years, then it became nightmare. I got so much work from so much things i dont like and dont feel like using at my future job that i lost all the positive feelings about my studies. Back then i wasnt so depressed but if i had oportunity to end my life painlessly without making my family suffer i would go for it 100% at any time of my life. Music helped me for some time but now even this doesnt help. I have friends i like to spend time with them but i still prefer to die than live. I cant even come with any viable reason why i dont enjoy anything. It just feels on and on the same. I finish one assignment, then there comes another. I know everyone got the same problems but i just dont see myself enjoying anything in the future. Maybe when i get a job something will change. I dont even dream about getting a girlfriend, i have too picky - too ugly problem. But that's ok, i should first try to be happy with myself right?
I took medicines (Effectin) for over a year and they helped to lower my giant social anxiety. Before i was like stressed 24/h wanted to die. Now i am not stressed anymore, just want to die.

"This is hard to write..I was expelled from school and ditched commonly due to my depression and self harming, so please forgive my lack of punctuation/bad punctuation and my just overall poor writing skills.

My name is Layla I am 20.. and I am suicidal. I think everyone here can relate to the never ending pain of life. To tell you about my life story of what mental illnesses I have and what caused them and all my past trauma.. well.. really is useless. We all have these horrible things that happen to us that have made us get to this point. Writing this is hard saying suicide out loud is fucking HARD. My family doesn’t know only my boyfriend because I live with him and it effects him a lot. I have a daughter with him which is something I’m sort of reluctant to share over the internet but I guess if I’m willing to post about her on Facebook then reddit is really no different.. social media is social media.. none is more dangerous than others. I tell you this because they are the only reason I am alive.. recently I have been increasingly more suicidal... got my letters written (cliche I know but my family will think it was a damn murder if they don’t get a letter I swear) so with this increase in desire and a plan.. I almost went through with it a couple of times now but my boyfriend was their to stop me and I woke up my daughter from my crying.. seeing him look at me with eyes saying ‘this is fucking ridiculous’ to my daughter upset because I’m crying.. I’m done it has made it to where them not seeing me this way anymore is the best reason to kill myself.. reaching out and letting my boyfriend know was a mistake because I can feel his judgment and tiredness of my bullshit already and it hurts. I try to search for reasons to not die all the time I have a list (one being rick and morty) these help all the way up until a panic attack and then I give 0 fucks about any of the reasons or anyone. I have went to therapy in the past and that helped ZERO going and telling a doc about a mother being suicidal welll... that’s not going to end well.. I’m not good right now and I know it and I certainly don’t need a god damn cps worker to come judge my life and mental state more than I do. It’s all scary it’s like I have a kid why isn’t it enough? Well it was enough until she started getting effected by my depression and now it’s a good reason for me not to be here and around her anymore. I’m not happy and Looking back at my childhood I really can’t remember a time where I had a happy normal life. I don’t know what peace feels like. 


Side note when I was 13 I hung myself in my closet. I tied the noose and just let loose.. I know for sure I passed out in a way because everything was black for a solid 30 seconds and I could see a red outline of what appeared to be my father (who is dead and has been since I was 9) I then came to still choking in the noose and able to get down. Once I got down I realized I had peed myself while passed out or whatever which I didn’t think was a thing.. I’ve told people about this and some say it was just a blackout and other say I had died but it wasn’t my time (you usually pee or poop when you die and not when you pass out) I just go with the passed out one because I truly do not know and claiming to die and come back can raise a lot of questions about a day I do not like talking about... I wish I would not have gotten myself down that day... my daughter wouldn’t of been born to this cruel world and have to see her mom like this now...

Anyways this will get lost in the other posts and it is very long and drowsy.. no interesting back story lol... if you made it this far thank you for reading through my shitty written emotions. If you want to know more about my life and shit..just let me know I’m fine with spilling all the abuse and gory details of my life that I’m supposed to be grateful for. 


I think I joined this community to not feel so outcasted and to be able to talk without the judgement or people thinking I’m looking for attention... i wish I just wanted attention I wish I didn’t feel this never ending sadness and despair that I honestly can’t find the right words to describe because being depressed and suicidal isn’t just plain sadness it is so many fucking emotions rolled into one but they are all negative... I don’t know.. I bet a lot of you know what it feels like and what I’m trying to convey here.. but thank you.. this place is relatable for once and so far non judgmental...",suicidal,high

"Suicidal thoughtsI’ve always had them but they’re really “loud” at the moment. Since New Years I’ve lost 4 friends I considered really close, I’m gaining weight and I really feel sick about it, I’ve never weighted this much before. I’ve lost my trust to my therapists so I can’t really use them at the moment. My best friend is pregnant and I’m SO happy for her but it just reminds me that I’m alone and I can’t get my own place because there’s no available apartments where I live, so I’m 25 and living with my mom. I just feel so alone. I’ve never been the kind of person that needs a boyfriends I’m fine being alone but I want to feel loved and wanted and I’m sick of the loneliness and being rejected. I feel like I’m stuck like this forever. There’s nothing more for me in this life. It’s not going to get better than this.
I usually try to avoid my suicidal thoughts but lately it just makes so much more sense. I’ve lived my life, there’s nothing more to complete or do now, all I can do is wait for me to get old and die of age but that doesn’t make sense either.

"I dont know how long i can keep fight against it anymoreIts since october 2016 that i got that enourmous spikes of suicide thoughts and i dont know how long i can handle them anymore. They are getting worse + stronger and lasting longer every time. I posted already a few times here. Had some nice tipps but they keep coming and getting stronger and stronger. I even made a suggested roadtrip but it didnt help. Now i even feel my chest hurting. 

Now they are really strong they last long . I am already close to tears while i am writing this. I already got my finished plans to end my life but i still to scared to execute them and i dont know how long this will keep me from doing it. If there is one more thing i dont know if that is my final push over the edge. 

Everything seems so senseless to me. My whole life makes no sense to me and i caught always in the same fucking loop of my problems and i work so hard on them there will always be a backlash and i cant fix them 100%. It makes me so sad that i cant fix these problems and i keep thinking about the one final solution without return.

I even had some soft attempts of doing it. First i went on the 23th november into the hospital with alcohol poisoning. Running around like mad in the streets with the chance getting overrun by a car. I was picked up by the emergency and police. 

On 31 december i was again so drunk and nearly passing out and picked up by friends.

"Seeking advice or company, anything really. I just don't want to be alone. [long post]I don't want to die. I experience suicidal thoughts often, however, and I feel like the only thing keeping me around is the fact that A. I would hurt my friends deeply and B. I don't want to leave this world painfully. 

More than anything, I just want to talk to someone. Anyone. I'm tired of burdening my friends with the same mental health turmoil, I've never been able to connect to a crisis chatroom despite waiting for 12+ hours at times, same with the hotline where I was on hold for hours. I would just like to talk to someone unbiased, someone who doesn't know me and who could maybe point me in a direction they'd go in. 

I'm currently stuck in a rut in life: not in school, lost my job recently following a temporary hospitalization for suicidal thoughts, have an unmanageable amount of debt (which isn't much, under $10k, but still daunting when I currently don't have a steady source of income). I dropped out of college three times because the environment was too overwhelming/I was fresh out of high school/I couldn't keep up with the work. I'm 24 now and I've been bouncing jobs a lot the past year. 

Recently I moved back in with my parents, one of whom has been a terrible source of abuse throughout my life, because I had nowhere else to go. I was unable to keep up with the financial requirements of my previous living situation (the wage/cost of living ratio was the most disproportionate in the entire country I discovered in a newspaper article). I wasn't able to make many friends out there and had more friends in the town my parents live in. It seemed like a better option.

The abusive parent has not been supportive despite claiming to be. Nothing is good enough. I am fully aware and deeply ashamed of my failures, mistakes, and shortcomings of an adult child having to move back in with their parents, but what hurts most is the parent's lack of empathy regarding my recent mental health struggles. The hospital visit I mentioned before did not help me--I did not receive a diagnosis beyond what I already knew, no meds, no inpatient hospitalization, just a list of people to call. The hospital visit ended up costing $4k and I don't have any more insurance coverage for a therapist or psychiatrist for the remainder of the year.

I feel like I would benefit greatly from returning to therapy and/or going back on medication (last time I was involved with either was 2011--parent I've been mentioning guilt tripped me to stop going to therapy/stop taking meds), but I am in a position where I can't afford anything at the moment. 

Abusive parent frequently tells me I don't do anything, that I just make the same mistakes, that I'm a burden to them and everyone else. When I get angry and protest or fight back with things I've been doing/trying, it goes in one ear and out the other. Parent has never been physically affectionate or interested in my hobbies/activites/well being. Never asks how I am. When we got into a fight the other they asked what they could do to help me and I said ""just ask me how I'm doing"". They said they do and that it's not fair for me to say that.

I am an artist/novelist with minimal sales, but money is money. I previously did independent contracting work I am considering returning to. I think general anxiety is stopping me. There have been some recent accomplishments too with art/writing! But none that my parent cares about. Parent is always totally willing to share details about their personal life/friends/etc. though. 

I am so grateful my parents let me move back into their house. Things were okay the first few months when I was employed, but then the hospitalization happened.

The obvious realization is ""hey sharky, maybe you should accept that things between you and your parent are probably always going to be shit"". And I do realize that. But I keep trying anyway. I don't know why. I just want parent to be proud of me/feel like I'm worth talking about/feel like I'm somebody, I guess. I'm ashamed and embarrassed of who I am but even expressing that outwardly is not good enough for parent. I feel like they hate me and it hurts. Other parent is totally indifferent to me. We don't speak even though we see each other. There's no animosity, just indifference.

I need to do the following things:
1. Postpone my student loan payments temporarily, because I do not have any income at the moment
2. Get a new job (I left my old one because of the suicidal thoughts hospitalization + my boss ended up stalking me immediately after I made a call saying I wouldn't be in that day) 
2a. Do some callbacks about places I have applied to. Some friends might have a job set up for me but stupid phone anxiety has prevented me from calling back + doing 1 as well.
3. Go back to school and get a degree. Any degree. 
4. Get a psychiatrist/therapist/counselor/support group/something.
5. Move out again

I WANT to do the following things:
1. Get a new job that doesn't make me want to kill myself
2. Go back to school, particularly art school (I have $4.3k in a college fund but I am afraid to go back in case I drop out again/I don't know what to do)
3. Move out again
4. Get some taco bell, but it's Yom Kippur and I am fasting until sundown tomorrow, but I can dream

Can somebody point me in a direction of maybe the first thing I should do? Should I share more information about anything I've listed? I don't want to tell my whole life's story and I don't want to subject anybody to listening to it either, but I'm frustrated and sad and tired of feeling like less than dirt. 

Thank you for reading.

And because of a really, really, REALLY stupid thing he did. He is our main breadwinner and insurance holder. My job doesn't even come close to our mortgage each month, let alone our bills.

I just went out to a festival event where I had a really bad time, in part due to the bad news, in part due to assholes flaunting the rules and festival staff doing nothing about it. I mentioned this on a Facebook group and ended up getting into it with an acquaintance that is my best friend's tennant.

"Not cut out for this lifeI would like to start by just providing a little information about myself. I am a 24 yo male. In January, I broke up with my boyfriend of 5 years. Now I've been in a different relationship for a few months and everything is going very well with him. We are talking about moving in together too. I graduated at 22 with a bachelor's degree - major in psychology and minors in child development and family studies.

After which, I went to a different University to attend their master of social work program that Fall. After two months I dropped out because it just wasn't right. I was having a lot of anxiety about the coursework and the actual duties of a social worker - namely the counseling side of things, which was my original goal for attending the program.

So the following semester I took a semester of online courses in accounting at a community college. It went well and I decided to go back to the same University I started the MSW with to pursue a bachelor's in accounting. This seemed like a good plan because I was living with my brother in an apartment at the time (because the thought of living with a random roommate terrifies me). However, when I started classes in the summer I felt very overwhelmed and anxious and unsure about whether I wanted to be in accounting. I dropped out before the end of the first week.

Then I didn't work for a while before I got a job as a pharmacy technician, which I quit after 3 weeks due to feeling overwhelmed and anxious. I ended up getting another job as a tech at a different pharmacy where I was able to work for 6 months.

After this I decided to go to grad school so I quit my job and moved after getting accepted to the computer science program (I have a 3.93 gpa). Of course, I started getting overwhelmed and anxious and ended up switching to the administration program before dropping out entirely (before even starting) and taking courses at the local community college for accounting again. They seem to be going alright. I just finished week 2 of classes. I also took an objectively amazing job at the secretary of state office as a student assistant getting paid more than I ever have. And guess how that went... I quit on day 3.


I guess I don't really want to kill myself, but I do secretly hope to get hit by a meteor or a Mac truck or simply not wake up tomorrow. I suppose I have always felt like this, but it was bearable without the pressures of society. I struggle to fit in anywhere. I can't handle pressure to perform but I also get bored and can't stand having to work at a job that I find so boring for 40 hours a week.

I don't know what to do. I've got another job prospect coming up at a bank. The interview went really well. I was optimistic that I could handle it but now I just don't know.

As the title says, I feel like I'm not cut out for this life - aside from being gay, maybe I'd be better off if I were born 200 years ago. Does anyone have any advice for me or thoughts about my situation?

"I don't know how to do this anymore.My husband lost his job due to a technicality with his short term disability paperwork, and the return to work date not matching or some bullshit.

My job is a day in, day out, same old crap. I've posted out numerous times but I can't seem to get out of this hellhole.

I don't even make enough money to cover the mortgage and the car payments on my own, and I was told I have to quit smoking because we can't afford my habit anymore. With my husbands unemployment we won't be able to pay the bills monthly and we'll just get further and further behind.

We're going to lose the house and I don't know what will happen to our 3 cats, especially our youngest who is my baby and the most vicious of the bunch. He'd probably get put down because no one would take him.

Monday I felt so bad I was contemplating playing in the highway traffic that is extremely close to my work (hopping a 3 ft fence close).

I have 1 day left of any sort of paid vacation for the rest of the year and I feel like taking it every single day. I don't have any motivation to do anything at work, and if I do take that one day left I can't leave my department because I'll get written up. Oh and every document I pass through quality control at work is the equivalent of taking someone's house away from them.... ironic huh?

I tried begging my doctor monday to write me out on short term disability for my breakdown but she ignored my request.

I've never been brave enough to take a knife to myself, and my husband would never get my life insurance that way, so I'm considering ramming my car into a tree, or something that will make the whole thing look more like an accident than a suicide. That way my ""family"" can live on without me at least for a little while.

Nothing makes me happy anymore.... I have no friends to talk to, and the only people I talk to reularly are my mother and my husband.

I feel like my marriage is a wreck, and the only reason I'm still here is sheer cowardice. I'm so sick and crying so hard just writing this that I'm gagging.

I need time to plan it out right, but I'm very, very close.

Edit- I also have several medical issues with my back that make mundane tasks such as a grocery store trip unbearable. I have to take Oxycodone to relieve the pain, and even then I just can't do that for the rest of my life...",suicidal,high

I'll bring one day flare and one night flare if I change my mind.  Regardless, I'll try to shoot one or the other off when I feel the end is near so they'll have an easier time finding the body.

We can't afford therapy, and we've already tried pills.  If I tell my parents they'll only plunge themselves into more debt trying to fix me.  My friends ignore my hints.  I tried telling one of them but it didn't go so well.

"still suicidal, but not avid on acting on it as muchI realize what i recently posted. I have major mood swings, which are part of the reason im suicidal. but i texted someone out of guilt because i cant stand hurting them. Sometimes you have to listen to people other than yourself and realize that you arent hated. People do love you. and thats all i ever wanted to hear. as someone who has childhood trauma and has always been neglected/emotionally abused by my parents, words have a lot of meaning to me. The person i love the most also has trauma, so hearing things from them means a lot. they never say they love me. But they did. it makes me rethink my decisions or what i wanted to do. i would feel guilty leaving these people behind. Im still extremely bad at friendships no matter how much i try, but i want to be able to manage my feelings better and try not to treat people badly because i dont know how to manage my own feelings. Ive been extremely mean to people in the past, and i believe that why i want to suddenly disappear so they dont have to deal with it.

But, they deal with it for a reason. If they didnt care they would have left a while ago. It still doesnt excuse my actions of course. I want to be held accountable but also realize that killing myself will also hurt them in a far worse way. I still do not like the mindset that suicide is “selfish”. Thats not what im trying to say. However, i couldnt imagine how they would feel. Losing a close friend to suicide. Ive also suddenly gotten a lot of posts or videos of people talking about losing someone to suicide, thats made me rethink things too. To anyone whos lost someone to suicide or to anyone whos suicidal, im sorry. I hope we can all feel better some day.

"clickI worked till closing time last Saturday.  I quite often don't.  I am in bad shape, in pain a lot of the time, and quite often a coworker wants to stay and close.  I usually let them, but not this time.  I needed the hours so that I would have enough to buy a gun to shoot myself.  So I kept going on my creaky old joints for another six hours, and then did the same the next time I worked.  

I am a failed experiment.  I don't quite fit in the human race.  That is a hell of a diverse group but I still don't fit anywhere in it.  There are all manner of saints and fools, perverts and heroes, idiots and psychos who manage to fit in somewhere.  I might just be stranger than all of them.  The way in which I am strange is hard to define or describe.  

When I have written about this before, the responses have been variations on well-meaning futility.  I tend to disappoint people who want to help me.  I do not think I am help-able.  No one gets it, because no one experiences it.  It's like I am a blind man, but I am the very first blind man in the history of the world and no one quite believes I really cannot see.  Well just open your eyes, they say.  Just look.  Looking is good, seeing is great.  And I can hardly argue with that, but it does me no good.

The thing I cannot do is connect with another person.  I am not a real person.  I am real, of course, but that is the best way I have ever found to express what it is like for me.  I see how other people are, and how I am, and whether they succeed or fail they at least seem to have the capacity to connect.  People talk to me about how their relationships aren't going well, and it's a bit like going up to a starving person and telling them how the restaurant messed up the steak orders last night.  But of course no one knows I am starving.

I was abused as a child.  That is such a trump card, a conversation stopper.  Well, that explains everything then.  I could say I wear a tutu and juggle dead badgers and if I say it is because I was abused as a child, then it all makes sense.  But it doesn't make sense, really.  I was abused, and so were lots of other people.  Many, probably most, deal with it better than I have.  I don't even know what ""dealing with it"" means.  I can't say what I would be like had the abuse not happened.  I have only been me once, and I can't rewind the tape and see how it would have turned out.  

I can say that what I endured as a child broke me, twisted me.  Whether it should have broken me, whether I should have ended up twisted into this particular shape I couldn't say.  But I did turn out like this, and there we are.  I can't connect with other people.

I wish I could say it better than that.  I can try to give an example.

Some years ago--more years than I would like to think about--I engaged in what probably seemed to be fairly typical behavior for a man.  I was 25 and Angela was 19 and we worked together.  It seemed typical because I became interested in her, and spent time with her, and was altogether shocked to find that she wanted me to do so.  But it was not typical because I was only pretending.

I didn't want to pretend.  I was not cynically trying to fool anyone.  I was desperate to believe I was having feelings that a normal person would have.  And in fact there were some feelings, which makes the whole thing more complicated and difficult.  I can't claim to be some alien sociopath with no emotions.  I wish I was, but apparently one cannot achieve that on purpose.  

There came a time when she offered herself to me, we were alone together and she made it sufficiently plain what she wanted.  And I felt nothing.  I became even more detached than usual and I seriously could have done anything or nothing, could have shot myself or had a sandwich, could have taken a nap or set myself on fire it would have made no difference.  There was no excitement, no fear, no lust, nothing.  It was supposed to happen, at long last I had a chance and lord knows she was intensely pretty and nice, and...nothing.  It was like flipping a light switch for a dead bulb.  Click, click, click.  Well, how immensely stupid.

I cannot complain about how women don't want me or how I have no success in dating, because success can't happen.  Click, click, click.  In the 20 years since Angela there have been a few attempts, not just at sex but at just being real, being close to someone, connecting.  It does not happen.  And that makes life an empty, stupid joke.  

Don't tell the blind man to look at more sunsets till he figures out how beautiful they are.  I am over forty and have yet to hold hands, I am alone in a more profound way than anyone this side of Tibet, and there is no solution for it.  Therapy, years of it, has proven to be futile, and medications even worse.  

So I get paid tomorrow, and then off to the pawn shop, then one last click.  This is not a cry for help.  There is no help.  And I am tired of pretending to be human.",suicidal,high

"Why live tho?I travel all over the country and work 60+ hours a week to make a couple of old men rich so they can brag about it. 

I was raised to be totally dependent on the rest of society (just like everyone else), so the money I have left after the government taxes me is used to pay rent (over half my paycheck) and to barely scrape by. I can't believe how much money my health insurance costs.

I have no friends. My mom actually said she'd be OK if I killed myself. I have no other family that cares.

All I do is work, and then I go to Walmart because that's the only groceries I can afford and I watch ladies with 5 kids use food stamps to pay for more groceries than I could eat in 3 months.

"The only reason I'm alive is because my husband tells me I can't kill myself, and I don't think I care anymoreI always answer my texts to my mother as soon as I can because if I make her wait, I will never hear the end of it. I thought it was weird that she wouldn't answer me for the last 5 days or so. And suddenly, yesterday, my mother-in-law called to ask why my father was in the hospital. I had no idea he was in the hospital. Some other backstory needed is my mother-in-law went to the hospital about a month and a half ago, nothing serious. She didn't tell us, she only posted about it on Facebook. Well my mother blew up my phone demanding why I didn't tell her, and why she had to find out on Facebook. I told her I had no idea what she was talking about, but then I saw the post. And she bitched me out for not telling her when I didn't know, and she refused to believe I didn't know.

That matters because my mother posted about my father being in the hospital on Facebook. I don't get on Facebook that much for my mental health. So when I asked her why my mother-in-law/Facebook had to tell me about my father because she was being a massive hypocrite, she told me that she texted me (she has no proof she texted me, and I have no texts from her), and then she told me, ""Well, I emailed it to you, too. I'm glad \*MIL\* told you because I doubt you'd ever know if not for her"".

Who the fuck emails their daughter about their father being in the hospital in 2020 when I'm made to text you at least 5 times a day?

I have a knife sitting next to me, and I plan to bleed at some point tonight. I know it won't kill me, but I wish it would. Or maybe I can go look at all the medications I've stashed and combine a bunch of them before I do it. I'm just so fucking tired.

The only thing I want to do is lay in bed and sleep. I finally reached out to a psychiatrist and therapist in June. The therapist lasted one session before she blew me off. The psychiatrist lasted a month before she stopped taking my calls. No one will return my calls and I have no idea what happened. It took a lot of trust to talk to someone about my problems yet again, it took a lot of energy to try new medications just for these people to just ignore me now. What professional misses appointments and then ignores their at risk clients?

I'm just angry at the world. I don't know what kind of god would ever let the things that happened to me happen. I don't understand how no matter what I do, it's never enough. I don't understand how nothing good ever happens. My birthday is next month, and I'm not looking forward to how disappointed I am in myself because I can't even feel an ounce of happiness on my own fucking birthday. I don't want to talk to anyone. I don't want to be alive. And I'm at a point where I don't care if I make anyone mad or unhappy when I finally kill myself.

I just wish I knew what made me so unworthy of nice things, of getting help, of being happy. But I can die not knowing. Have a great life, everyone.",suicidal,high

"Fiance broke up with meTitle. Fiance broke up with me after 10 years of being together. Started dating at 13. Engaged at 18. Broke up 3 weeks ago. Was suicidal then. Started doing ok. Found out she started fucking one of her friends the day after we broke up and they are dating. We were supposed to go to a wedding together. She told me she was going alone. Found out she went with him. 

Want to die. She was my entire life. Now I have noone and she doesn't have to deal with the same pain because she has new guy. We were each other's first everything. I have no idea how to even go about finding anyone else and she's already moved on. 

Everytime I feel like I'm starting to get over it something else sets me off. It's not getting any easier. Therapy doesn't help. Talking to people doesn't help. Keeping busy doesn't help. It's been 3 weeks and it doesn't hurt any less. 

I understand I'm only 23 and the odds of it working out were astronomical. Rationally I know I'm being immature and dramatic. But it still hurts so bad and I feel like I will never have anything like that again. 

So I want to end it to stop ruining other people's lives and let her get in with hers.

"Suicide is just indirect murder.It might not be attributable to one individual, but it isn't nature or circumstance that does it, it's other people. It might be family, others we know personally, groups, social structures, or society as a whole. Regardless, you're not killing yourself, you're being killed by the mistreatment of others. 

It might not kill you immediately either. Rarely in war are there these single climactic battles that begin and end it all. It can be one battle where the losses are too high, where a side fails to recover, where the initiative is lost and the dynamic shifts.

That I’ve never been able to support or empathize with her. I suppose she’s right. We fight all the time. I go from self loathing to mood swings and yelling matches. Last week I swore up and down I’d be there for her and today I had one little fuck up and she lays into me, how nothing fucking matters, how I’ll never be able to support her. That I’ll never be able to handle her and her family. It’s true to some extent, I had it pretty good as a kid, she didn’t. She’s right, I don’t or can’t grasp what she’s been through because I never had it. We both have anxiety and depression. She thinks when i am honest about my suicidal thoughts that I use it as a tactic to manipulate her into caring for me. 

I can’t tell her about the times I’ve thought about the taste of gunmetal, what that would feel like to know that’s the last taste I’ll ever taste. Or the walks up to the train tracks late at night, considering whether or not I should just step in front of a train. I can’t tell her I’ve been scouting out high beams around the house that would support my fat ass when I decide to throw an extension cord noose around one of them. The garage won’t work, that shits to poorly made to support me. I can’t tell her how many times I’ve considered ending it all. 

I can’t tell her that I constantly am sick of my inability to be empathetic and emotionally supportive for her. That I’m so ashamed of the fact that I have expected nothing of her and all she thinks is that I expect her to fix everything. 6 months ago I found out I was the reason we couldn’t start a family, our dream of have a big family dashed in a matter of minutes, followed by a huge fucking medical bill I can’t afford to pay off because I’m the only one working. In her defense,she’s been trying to find work, just nothing pans out.  She’s going to leave me, and I can’t fucking blame her. Who would want to be with a pathetic piece of shit husband like me. I don’t even want to be here any more.  My depression and mood swings got the better of me and now I fear I may have jeopardized the one income this household has.  My job is on the rocks, along with my marriage, the bills are crashing down around me, 

I just think, fuck, I can’t maintain so if I were gone, she’d only have to worry about herself. She wouldn’t have me fucking up her life anymore than I already have.  Tonight, she was drinking again, so naturally we we’re fighting.  She knows exactly where to put the knife and twist when we fight.

I truly gave myself too much time since starting posting here (June of this year) to be successful, of course I failed.

"Am I overreacting?Hi reddit, so recently it has dawned on me that some people just don’t know anything. So a little backstory, I had depression for about a few months where I physically was not able to get up and moving and has suicidal issues . I never did get proper treatment as I never really came out about this because my parents are very religious and they’ll just say “go pray some more” and nobody really cared and thought I was just an arrogant, spoiled, brat and this adds up to the fact I’m agonistic and didn’t tell anyone but my uncle who doesn’t care about how religious I am. So recently, my parents were trying their hardest to figure out why I was such I guess a weirdo. So they were basically telling me to stop being so moody and start being more mature. And me not having any of it started yelling and I stormed off crying in my room. Later, my older sister said that I was acting like such an asshole to my parents and that I was overreacting(She already knew about my depression and my thoughts) and to stop making others uncomfortable. I told her she can go Fuck off and to leave me alone as I still have reoccurring memories of me wanting to die and I’m very sensitive about it and all she’s doing is making it more stressful. I’ve tried coming to terms with my parents about my depression and they just told me to shut up and go away.So reddit, you tell me did I do something wrong because I need advice and some support.",suicidal,high

i randomly explode into tears for what seems like no apparent reason. i cant get motivated to do anything, responsibilities are starting to pile up and im cracking under the pressure. i've tried anti depressants and although they do make me feel better, the side effects are just too much to bare to continue taking them.

what do i do? i can't leave this place and and i cant move on with myself, i need help :(",suicidal,high

5. Phone checks randomly, I usually get yelled at over nothing

"I’ve hit my breaking point finallyMy life has constantly been suffering, and torture. I have always been smart, but everyone called me a nerd, I have no friends in school, I am beaten up after school most days. And thats just at school. At home no one cares about me, my siblings beat me up, and my mom told me that I was a failed abortion. And today, I just snapped. I just thought about committing suicide. I’m pretty sure no one would care about my death. I just made this account to express how I feel. I am done with life.",suicidal,high
"My girlfriend of 3 years left me, please helpI'm sorry if this seems disjointed, or even overly calm, I don't know how I should be feeling at the moment, the only thing I know is that if I threw myself in front of a train this pain would stop for good.

She left me about a fortnight ago, and i've taken it fairly well up until now. She kept saying she still wants to be my friend, and that she still cares about me, that I still have a place in her heart, but actions speak louder than words and she ignores me when I need to talk to her the most, holds the smallest of things against me, and is generally making me feel worthless/like she wants me dead.

what makes it worse is that I've always tried to give her the best of everything, and being with her was the only thing I looked forward to at the end of the day. I no longer speak to my family for personal reasons and have no friends where I currently live, and i'm not able to move anywhere else due to a lack of funds. I literally tried to give her the world, before I lost my job I was saving up and was going to surprise her for her birthday in 2 years, letting her choose where on earth she wanted to go, and for how long.

Now I just feel like I'm falling with nothing to grab on to, I can't take pleasure from even the smallest of things like playing a video game over the net with a few guys I know (once again, met over the net) because my thoughts always go back to her and her beautiful smile.

I can't see any reason to go on when the only reason I truly care about doesn't care about me anymore, please, just give me something to look forward to, something to change my mind before I do something stupid, because it seems like it's the only way I won't feel like I've been poisoned from the inside at the moment.

EDIT: Thank you all so much for your support, it's still going to be hard but from what you've all said taking some time for myself is definitely the best idea at the moment. In answer to one of the questions, I do contact juggling (I believe you call them Fugashi balls in America) and I'm learning a few card tricks, so I have something to keep myself occupied.

again, thank you all.",suicidal,high

"I don't deserve to liveNot an exaggeration. I'm a horrifying human being. I'm angry and I take it out on others (not physically). I'm just pure evil. I'm filth and vermin and every day I'm alive is food and water wasted.

I lash out and I hurt people and I regret it. Every day I know that my death would be a blessing for this world. 

I just wish that I wasn't such a monster, but I'm stuck on two settings: ""Attack"" and ""Defend."" I will hurt anyone who tries to get close, because I don't deserve to be happy or to be loved. I've driven away every person who's tried. I make them hate me, and thus see reason. 

And yet I'm too much of a coward to go, even though it's the one gift that I deserve. I don't want to be here anymore. I can't fucking take it. I hate every molecule of myself. 

I'm so fucking lonely, and it's all my fault. I pray every night that I won't wake up, and I always do. 

Most people on here don't deserve to feel this way, they're good people with wonky brains. I'm the one person who deserves depression, who deserves to hate himself, who deserves to be tortured and beaten and whipped and hurt in every way possible. I deserve it all. I deserve this. 

And it will never get better. I will be this miserable until I die. And I wish I was brave enough to end my own life the way everyone wants me to. ",suicidal,high

"How do I stop crying?How do I stop thinking about the lost love, the lost opportunity, the waste of a life I'm living, the loneliness, how happy I could be at this moment if I had done only a few things differently in my life, chances I will never get back?

How do I stop waking up with the very first thought not being that I'm hungry or that I need to shower or whatever, but instead elaborate fantasies about walking into the woods and hanging myself? How do I stop playing with the rope once or twice every single morning, just tying and re-tying knots? 

I feel so desperate. I've talked to so many people, telling them ""I'm having a rough time."" I've talked to therapists. It feels good while I'm in their offices, but I still have to go home. I still have to be alone. Am I just waiting for numbness? Because once numbness comes I won't want to kill myself, but I also don't want to live a grey, bleak life. I can't stop crying. I've never felt so God damn alone. I don't want to die. But I just can't feel like my heart is bleeding every single morning and all day every day. I'm more scared than I've ever been.

"One year anniversary since my last big suicide attempt. Hello, redundancy.Since 13, I have been suicidal on and off, mostly on. Having been diagnosed with Borderline Personality Disorder, I've been told that for people like ""us"" suicide becomes kind of an obsession.

I am scared of the world, I'm not afraid to admit I'm a coward. I have just let myself go so far that I don't let myself feel anything for anyone. I'm floating away from life.

I've been through therapy, I am in therapy, I want to get past therapy but the drive to live has shrunken into a raisin and I have no intentions to rehydrate.

I don't want to be here, but I am posting here because I have to honor the little glimmer of hope there is, for my friends or for my family. Otherwise, I'm worried tonight is the night, yet again, but this time not an attempt. 

I'm sorry to bother you all, I'm sure I sound all over the place I just feel frantic and I dread every moment that I am still breathing.",suicidal,high

“The beans. WHERE ARE THEY?!”

And two other friends of mine jumped out behind him and I asked “What are you doing?!”

“Me and the boys are looking for beans”

"Is it weird that I sort of romanticise suicide in my head.....Like I daydream about it and think about it at night. But not in a pained way, not while in distress. Just calmly. I like the visual idea of me being in a hospital bed sending a Snapchat story out of me being there and alerting everyone on my social media that I tried to take my own life. I sort of idealise me being in that situation. But not me being dead- me having attempted but survived. I don’t know if it’s a thing of me wanting people to care about me or if I’m being weird. I sort of feel like a bad person for romanticising me being in that place. Maybe I think if I was really in that situation people would care about me, people would finally like me. That I would have to be living on the edge for people to show they value me. I daydream about being in a hospital bed or being in a psych ward, sending a snapchat of my hand with a drip taped to it or me crying. I imagine if I would get replies of people showing concern and that they care about me. I sort of want that to happen. Not to attempt suicide but to receive the care some (not all) people receive afterwards. I want people to know how much I am struggling. Maybe I think I would have to be in that place to speak up. To reach out for help and write on social media about it. Then maybe people would listen",suicidal,high

"I know it's trite, but literally nobody likes me.This is difficult. Because either what I'm saying is true and I'm an abhorrent individual, or literally every person in my life is a narcissist using me as a step stool to feel taller. It's been happening so long I can't even figure out the cause and effect anymore. But even when I try to be kind, or communicate effectively, my efforts are very much rebuffed. I know when I get anxious I shut down, and then I short circuit when I'm being gaslit (I think? I don't know!!! The confusion is the worst part!!!) 

I just want to be gone so everyone isn't so bothered by me. My parents hate me, my boyfriend hates me, the rest of my family hates me. Anyone I've ever been friends with, without exception, have taken advantage of me, backstabbed me, stolen from me, or destroyed things I loved out of spite, just for me being me, in one instance, standing up for my daughter, in another, someone ELSE'S daughter. These are not exaggerations, and these are not ideas or impressions I have drawn upon in my own head. These are verifiable facts and real words and actions that have been witnessed. 

All of the people I say hate me have said as much, repeatedly. But when I ask for reasons why I get vague things like ""you're a bitch"" or projections of the problems I've brought up with them in the past. Depression and PPD have also wreaked havoc with me this past year, which means lately I get called gross, lazy, unfit mother (and this is just from my mom- she hates that I'm ok with clutter, and showering is my impossible thing sometimes) 

I have also not been an angel in my life. I have retaliated at times. I have a mouth like a sailor. When hurt or cornered I can be like a bear. I speak my mind to my own detriment at times. Socially I'm pretty retarded. But whenever I know I have caused pain all I want to do is fix it. 

I'm not sure if I'm crazy, they're crazy, we're ALL crazy, or if I'm just broken and need to disappear, amputating the broken limb from the healthy whole. Because I don't see any other way out. I can't keep a job, because I put out instant hate me vibes everywhere I go, so I don't have any money, I just want to curl up and give up. I've got nothing left. I'm so tired. ",suicidal,high

"I am a Apache AH-64 attack helicopter The AH-64 Apache has a four-blade main rotor and a four-blade tail rotor.[44] The crew sits in tandem, with the pilot sitting behind and above the co-pilot/gunner.[45] Both crew members are capable of flying the aircraft and performing methods of weapon engagements independently.[46] The AH-64 is powered by two General Electric T700 turboshaft engines with high-mounted exhausts on either side of the fuselage.[47][48] Various models of engines have been used on the Apache; those in British service use engines from Rolls-Royce. In 2004, General Electric Aviation began producing more powerful T700-GE-701D engines, rated at 2,000 shp (1,500 kW) for AH-64Ds.[49]

The crew compartment has shielding between the cockpits, such that at least one crew member can survive hits. The compartment and the rotor blades are designed to sustain a hit from 23 mm (0.91 in) rounds. The airframe includes some 2,500 lb (1,100 kg) of protection and has a self-sealing fuel system to protect against ballistic projectiles.[50] The aircraft was designed to meet the crashworthiness requirements of MIL-STD-1290,[51] which specifies minimum requirement for crash impact energy attenuation to minimize crew injuries and fatalities. This was achieved through incorporation of increased structural strength, crashworthy landing gear, seats and fuel system.

On a standard day, when temperatures are 59 °F (15 °C), the AH-64 has a vertical rate of climb of 1,775 feet per minute (541 m/min), and a service ceiling of 21,000 feet (6,400 m).[52] However, on a hot day, when temperatures are 70 °F (21 °C), its vertical rate of climb is reduced to 1,595 fpm (486 m/min), and service ceiling is reduced to 19,400 feet (5,900 m) due to less dense air.[53]

Avionics and targeting

AH-64 Apache in flight
One of the revolutionary features of the Apache was its helmet mounted display, the Integrated Helmet and Display Sighting System (IHADSS);[54][55] among its capabilities, either the pilot or gunner can slave the helicopter's 30 mm automatic M230 Chain Gun to their helmet, making the gun track head movements to point where they look. The M230E1 can be alternatively fixed to a locked forward firing position, or controlled via the Target Acquisition and Designation System (TADS).[56][57] On more modern AH-64s, the TADS/PNVS has been replaced by Lockheed Martin's Arrowhead (MTADS) targeting system.[58]

U.S. Army engagement training is performed under the Aerial Weapons Scoring System Integration with Longbow Apache Tactical Engagement Simulation System (AWSS-LBA TESS), using live 30 mm and rocket ammunition as well as simulated Hellfire missiles. The Smart Onboard Data Interface Module (SMODIM) transmits Apache data to an AWSS ground station for gunnery evaluation.[59] The AH-64's standard of performance for aerial gunnery is to achieve at least 1 hit for every 30 shots fired at a wheeled vehicle at a range of 800–1,200 m (870–1,310 yd).[60][61]",normal,low

"I'm tired of thisI have no one to talk to in real life, and I figure at least this way I could get my thoughts out before I make any decision but here goes.

I've been down for a while, even before COVID, but that was due to a plethora of factors. For one, I realize that for me, I've given up on establishing connections with people. My parents never understood, nor bothered to realize that anything was wrong because they were always busy taking care of other family members. I genuinely cannot connect with people and it's not a matter of trying. My mom would always compare me to my cousins or other girls who were social and keep making comments like ""Why don't you have friends? What's wrong with you?"" I figure it's less painful to forgo the  process entirely as opposed to eventually either be used or made fun of by others. Can't regret things this way, haha.

I didn't want to go to my current university or study my current major. When I came in, my intent was to pick an ""easier"" major because my top choice after college was heavily GPA focused, and just take whatever prereqs I needed later on. I didn't get that choice. When I brought it up, my mom, and even my dad kept talking about how it would be useless and I wouldn't get a job. My current major was picked by mom because *she* wanted to pursue it due to a family tragedy. She picked my extracurriculars, because *she* picked my backup career. Only problem is that I don't have the personality or patience for it. My college? My parents wouldn't let me go away from home because they wanted me in the area.

This next thing is my total fault, but I never realized I had a bad attention span. Like, I could b.s. my way through classes when I was younger due to my memory, but in college it started to cause big issues. I would sit for five hours and not be able to process things. I brought up these concerns to my mom who just told me I was ""lazy"" so I felt embarrassed and only tried harder. Obviously that didn't do anything, and I ended up ruining my earlier classes. It wasn't until I got treatment where I realized that when treated for it, I could actually get shit done pretty fast without as many errors. Only catch is that it's too late for me which brings me to my next point.

I've already mentioned I given up on the social side of things. These past few years, I've been obsessively trying to pursue something for two reasons. For one, I was always compared against family and pressured into this career path when I was younger. But more importantly, I actually wanted to pursue it. Considering I hate my university and would rather walk into traffic right now versus receive further schooling in the major that I hate, this career path would've permit me to do something I think is cool while simultaneously giving me a solid reason to always be busy. 

Only problem is is that things are ruined beyond repair. I hate to admit it, but I idolized someone I was always compared to when I was little. She was athletic, I managed to fracture a foot *walking*. She had many, many friends, I cannot name a single one. She was smarter, I not only went into college wanting to pursue her major, heck her minor (which I was rejected from). But she managed to get into the only club I wanted to get into at my campus which rejected me 4x! The first three I kept getting further in the interview to only naturally be rejected because as a fucking autistic I'm compared to people that have much, much better interviewing skills. 

She went into my dream school, I couldn't give a shit about ranking, I just wanted that place because I idolized that city when I was younger because I figured it's filled with freaks and maybe I'd fit in by comparison. In terms of research, she got to get into the lab under the PI that everyone wanted, I got a PI that would make fun of the way I talked, mimic me, call me stupid, and compared my expression to a dog. I switched labs solely for the intent of getting a letter of rec and I figured that due to their subject topic, they'd have to be nicer-------boy was I wrong. Not only did my three supervisors treat me with micro-aggressions, not only did another supervisor purposely retain me within the program due to having Aspergers, but even when I asked if I could continue volunteering remotely (I was denied), I wasn't given the letter of rec because my ""time was cut short for things out of my control."" 

If that's not bad enough, what's the probability of falling into the application cycle that corona affected? Not only can I not study at home because my family members blast music to help a family members condition, to the detriment of my ability to study. But a ton of news sources are saying that the professional school process for this program has gotten and in future cycles, will only be more and more difficult.

This was when I realized that life isn't worth living, at least for someone like me. The only thing I wanted in life was snatched from my grasp yet again. Not only did my parents, particularly my mom, not believe in me throughout this process. I was constantly put down and reminded my cousins are smarter. But now, I genuinely have no hope. It's not a matter of retrying, this particular cycle was my only opportunity to be able to move out from my parents house on time. I already have no friends and have been taken advantage of or bullied by people throughout my life. Now that the only thing that gave me purpose has been snatched, I realize that for me, I'm genuinely tired of this, more so than I ever have within my life. The sad thing is that writing this I omitted so many damn tragedies that happened these past few years. This isn't life, for me this is a living hell.",suicidal,high

"A life worth losingI'm not articulate, so please forgive me. Brain-damaging psychiatric drugs, specifically Chlorpromazine and other neuroleptics, were forced upon me as a child for ""moodiness"".

I cannot tolerate social situations, even being around my extended family will trigger a panic attack. I withdrew school in the sixth grade because my mother claimed homeschool status. Bullshit!

"Ben Shapiro is invading my dreams I'm honestly about as lost and confused as you are. For some reason whenever Ben Shapiro enters my dreams, I remember the dream vividly.

The first time he invaded my dream, I was in a university class and Ben Shapiro suddenly became the professor, and started to lecture the class of his beliefs. I said I disagreed and we went on a full debate about our own beliefs, some of it is heavy TW so I won't post it, but it was mainly about trans people and their position in our world, and it led to non-binary discussion and I was really scared I would out myself to a figment of my own fucking imagination. The dream ended abruptly but it was still extremely vivid.

The second dream was a lot weirder.

I can't remember what was before this part of the dream, but I was in a blank, light gray room that would have a somewhat ""L"" shape in it. When I turned the corner, I see Ben Shapiro himself, along with Rick Harrison and my Computer Science teacher all sitting on a blank light gray table, the exact same colour as the walls. On the other side was someone that looked similar to one of my classmates, short dark hair with large glasses wearing a black shirt and blue jeans. I think the context of this was after the debate of the first dream, my parents made Ben Shapiro my personal tutor to learn conservative beliefs, and he had fucking assignments with him about them. I was writing on the assignment, I can't remember what the questions were except for one, which was views on same sex relationships. I again, did not want to out myself to Ben Shapiro so I kept it blank. I remember just staring at the question for hours and for some reason the dream was just a loop of this.

The third dream is a lot more vague, it's a light gray room, this time just a square room, no turns, no windows, just 2 chairs, a table, and a LED light above the table. Ben Shapiro is on the other side, and apparently he found out I was non-binary and bisexual, and I remember just crying.

I have no idea what the fuck is going on with my mind, nor why specifically Ben Shapiro manifested my dreams, I don't even follow politics anymore. I feel like I'm in Inception right now, and I have no clue if I'll need psychological help.",normal,low

It is very surprising to me that it took almost 5 years after my mom's death to figure this out.something that completely i didn't notice i was doing but my mind was.even though once i come to a point where i totally become alone I won't regret this philosophy because it's something what i choose and I won't back down from it and face it's consequences....",normal,low

"Killing myself is the only way to protect those around meI’m an 18 year old male, and mentally ill. I have severe anxiety, anger issues, and OCD with constant intrusive thoughts. Sometimes I pity myself and wonder why all of this stuff happened to me. Other times I tell myself to just suck it up and deal with it. Last year, in my junior year of high school, all of my pent up feelings erupted during an argument with my mother over school grades. I impulsively shouted that I wanted to kill her, and knocked her down to the ground. Luckily, my brother was near, so he ran over and tackled me to stop myself. I tried to run upstairs and grab a gun, in order to shoot myself to stop myself from harming anyone else. Truth be told, I don’t know if I actually wanted to kill myself. It didn’t matter, as my family ran upstairs and stopped me. Afterward, I was taken to the mental hospital for a week. It was the only time in my life that I had ever felt “normal” around others, and adjusting back to regular life was hard. It’s been a year, and I still think about the whole incident monthly. A part of me wants to just end my life so that I can’t ever hurt anyone again. I just need some direction, and to not feel so alone and full of guilt.

"My spouse and I will die together.He's hurting and so am I. We are in completely different countries and he's just hopeless. I'm not strong. I can't handle both of our sorrows. I love him and want to be with him, but as living being it's just not gonna happen. So why not make our last moment together our last moment on Earth.

We have both attempted suicide a couple of times before, obviously we failed. We are scared and not sure how to do it to guarantee success. He's more into drowning since he can't swim, and I would rather suffocate using a plastic bag. My fear is if we somehow decide to die one next to the other, and one dies while the other stays alive. Just the thought of it scares me. 

There is absolutely nothing we can do about our situation. Nothing we can do to make him feel better. I can't handle it anymore. I just want us to feel better. If that means death, then so be it. I'm terrified but so be it. I don't want to live a life without him and I'M sure one day he will kill himself. And I would rather be with him that day, doing the same. 

I'm desperate and sad and scared but what can I do. I truly don't know what to do. Maybe he's dead right now, who knows. He abruptly just stopped replying to my messages. I tried calling him but his phone is disconnected. All social media, he won't reply and the message won't even reach him. I sent him a message saying I'll come to his country and let's do it. I don't know if it was wise to do so but I'm just so sad and desperate. I don't know what else to do. Literally nothing will help us. Nothing. ",suicidal,high

"I can't stop hating who I am. I only want to be a normal woman.I am a late 20's woman and I have always hated myself. I wake up in the morning and hate my appearance, I hate how undisciplined I am, I hate my job, I hate my life, I hate how I speak, I hate where I live, everything. I hate everything about myself. This hatred of who I am has affected literally every aspect of my life. I don't try to get a nicer job because I think ""hey they won't hire me"". I don't ask out men that I'd like to because I know they would not find me attractive, I don't take any risk that would lead to a positive outcome because I know it will fail. I have been an insecure, depressed mess of a person since I was a teenager and things are not ""getting better"". Things did not change for me, they got worse. I want to improve but I physically cannot, my mind mentally blocks me all the fucking time. It's like there is a part of my soul that knows I can do better but the darkness of depression suffocates it and wins every battle. I'm sorry for ranting here but I wasted my youth being depressed and socially anxious and all I want to be is to be the type of woman to dress up and go out to fun parties, or go on dates, or be fun or flirty.

"VentingI don't know where else to put this, so here goes. 

The thought of our gun cabinet has been close at hand for weeks now. I can't stop it. I can't seem to stop being so depressed. 

Five years ago I was diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia and depression. The hallucinations I can live with, but lately the depression has been too much. 

The worst part is I have no reason to be depressed. I have the happiest, most beautiful baby you could ever see. My husband loves me more than life itself, and I love him twice as much. I have a job that I am at simply because I love it, and if we wanted we could both quit our jobs and retire on our savings.

So why do I feel this way? It isn't ennui - we had to work, and I worked HARD, to get here. I just don't know how much more I can push on.

I finished him because he was an asshole and still is! For the last 10 years I have been with a great guy who I love very much. I had an abortion 4 years ago, I was devastated when I found out I was pregnant and fortunately live in a country where terminations are accessible. I do not regret my abortion but it was not a happy point in my life. I think perhaps my ex getting his gf pregnant brought this all back? I don't know, feelings are so complicated. All I know is that I feel like shit and do not know how to make myself feel any better. I have had some feelings of ending it all just so I don't feel awful anymore.

"A Suicidal Rant?I don't really mind if nobody sees this, I don't really expect anyone to reply, I just need to rant out my feelings. I just feel trapped in my life, and in my body. If anybody does read this then I'm sorry for the length.

First of all, my workplace, it's the most toxic workplace, I work at a supermarket and a lot of the people there are high school age, making the place very gossip orientated. Everyone in my department acts like a teenager, they bully each other, then complain about getting bullied. Everyday I get insulted by the same coworkers who claim everyone else treats them poorly. I am threatened, I've been kicked by a coworker and I'm just told to not take it personally or that then threatening to hurt me is their sick sense of humour. I've gone to my departments management but she is just as toxic, HR is horrible too and we're not allowed sick days. I feel trapped there, I'm suicidal almost everyday now. I've tried talking to coworkers about the hostility and they just continue to do it. People's parents call the workplace telling them that their kid comes home crying almost everyday, and that their kid is being bullied. Im not allowed to use anyone there as a reference making it hard to get into other jobs, hence why I feel so stuck. 

The other thing; my almost non-existent self-esteem. I have no confidence, I feel huge in my body and refuse to leave the house without wearing a oversized jumper or coat, even when it's hot and I'm sweating. I'm convinced I'm this huge waste of space, it's true that I've caused this to myself, I've always bullied myself and I'm not sure how to stop it and I'm uncomfortable going to someone to talk about it professionally because of past experiences. I feel immense guilt whenever I eat before 9PM, and just whenever I eat anything, which leads to me bingeing at night, every night. I get so suicidal over this, I feel like a failure for eating, I feel like I have to starve, I can't accept the weight I am at. But I don't know how to eat healthily anymore, all I know is how to starve and overeat. Food is just calories for me, it's not something I enjoy, it's something I feel panicked about and I know that's not normal, but I feel too huge to ask for help, like my bad relationship with my body image and food wouldn't be taken seriously. It used to just be my body that I didn't like, but now it's become my face and personality as well.

I don't have friends, I have people who I call my friends but they're not, they're what I call the ""pity"" friendship. Where they only hangout with me out of pity, and they don't even hangout with me anymore. I used to play games with this person online, they were my friend until they started bullying me too. I have nobody, I've got my boyfriend and he's my best friend but I need other friends. Sometimes I don't even want friends because of how much damage friendships has caused me, it feels like so much stress.

I don't know where I was going with this, but rants over. ",suicidal,high

"Why is dying so scary?I honestly don't want to live, but being brought up in a judeo Christian society I have fear around death and pain.  I'm not religious, but I had a weird chemical/dmt mindfuck the first time I tried to kill myself where I could choose to live or die and I knew that what ever decision I made would be final and I looked at death and it was this dark void and I looked at life and all of its pain, Loss and misery, which would be certain and I chose certainty over uncertainty and then I came to right as that happened, covered in blood and I rode my bike to the ER.  It was a little traumatic and the effects of compound trauma are again weighing deeply in me.  I want the uncertainty in that dark void.  If I could choose again I'd have chosen death, but the pain I will have to experience to get there again is truly extreme.  I don't want to live through something like that again and be hospitalized again.  Life has just become agonizing and my anxiety is ceaseless.  I can't function and it appears that I am going to starve.  I just want to die quietly.  I wish there was death with dignity for depressed people.  I feel that my disease is in fact terminal.

Additional thoughts: I found it difficult to answer all of the questions effectively as many of them would depend on the nature of the mental health issues as some seem more socially accepted than others. For some people telling your current supervisor that you have a history of bi-polar disorder might be easier than telling a potential employer that you have a history of compulsive gambling. They might both be bits of irrelevant information (past behavior and not indicators of future behavior). However western culture pushes us to appear as capable as possible to our supervisors in pursuit of excellence in our work. Providing information that could create a negative bias seems like a more genuine and yet more risky approach to the discussion.,depression,medium

"Planning My Death at 28I've had recurring depression and suicidal thoughts since I was a teenager. Now at 28 I've recently started antidepressants, and things seemed to get better until recently. What probably triggered the depression this time was a rough year with a bad breakup, getting laid off, and the difficulty and rejection job-hunting. I got help, got anti-depressants, got a new job where I make more than I did before, and my friend who was allergic to her kitten asked me to adopt him and I adore him. Things were looking up, but the past few weeks, the old feelings have come back with a vengeance. I'm having a hard time getting out of bed, cry all the time, have lost all interest in my creative outlets, and have self-doubts in my new job, wondering if I'm cut out for it. 

This isn't the first time I've planned my death. I have a will written up that I want to get official and get a lawyer. I have life insurance policies both through work and independently. I want to die before my loved ones, before my mom, before my sisters, before my friends. I know that is beyond selfish and makes me a bad friend, sister, and daughter, but I can't bear the thought of losing them and am more content with the idea of dying and leaving them with money to live better lives. Most of their stress is financial, like how my mom works three jobs. I don't have a method planned, I just know it can't be obvious suicide, because then it would be pointless.

I have it in my will I want a bio urn, I want to become a red crepe myrtle tree. I want to go back to the earth and make new life with my death.

My problems ain't such as no money, unemployed, having a disability.. It's just my family and surroundings. I'm under 18 and even tho my monthly income would be enough to live alone, I can't since I'm under 18. My parents are treating me horrible and give me the feeling to kill myself every day and I'm really close to it.

Sadly my father works at the same company so he visits me sometimes and just make me feel worse in front my work mates.  
I'm not sure if he doesn't know how bad of a father he is, but he just doesn't seem to know. He things he's doing the best even tho he just makes me want to kill myself.  
Added to that my parents are extremly intolerant to ""unnormal"" things like not being born in the same country we live in(even tho they're not themselve..), different sexual orientation and so on.  
Being a Bisexual Guy doesn't benefits any of that.  
Everytime I'm outside with my parents and they see someone who doesn't behave like a ""normal"" guy or girl, they just talk hours about ill they are and weird, making me feel even worse.   
My internet access is capped as well, I have none at phone and none at My computer.  
I'm not allowed to go outside of the city and if I leave the house in my spare time, they always question it and want to know exactly where I am and why, or don't allow me go at all.  
I just want my own life, my own decisions, and If I don't manage to live alone and end up killing myself I will at least know it's my fault and I fucked up.",suicidal,high

"Hopeless situation?I want to start off by stating English isn’t my first language. Please excuse any any grammatical/spelling errors I may make.

So I don’t really know how to start this story. It’s long and complicated, but I’ll keep short and to the point. It’s about how I got to my current hopeless situation, which I don’t seem able to get out of.

It started a few years back. I was hanging with friends as usual, nothing out of the ordinary, except my “friends” weren’t really great people. These guys would constantly taunt and make fun of my appearance. Sometimes they would go as far as physically attacking me. Whenever I told to stop, they just would continue, laughing at how pathetically weak I was.

Eventually I had enough, and decided being antisocial is much better than hanging out with my asshole “friends” (in hindsight, that was a terrible decision). And by antisocial I really mean antisocial. Like I would come from school and play video games till the next day. That’s essentially how I lived for a few years. The end result was me developing extreme social anxiety as well many other diseases, both physically and mentally.

Pretty sure I’m also mentally ill. Like actually crazy. Basically, I talk to myself all the time, and I laugh like a crazy person and make weird gestures, for absolutely no reason. Don’t know what’s wrong with me honestly. Maybe my childhood PTSD coupled with my teenage problems fucked up my brain?

Right now I’m suffering physically. My IBS has destroyed me completely. The doctor I go to thinks my IBS is nothing to be afraid of. I disagree but it doesn’t matter. So now I have to suffer mentally and physically, as well as socially. Life doesn’t feel good, to say the least 

There’s nothing that makes more mad than waking up in the morning. People have dreams and goals everyday waiting to be fulfilled. I, on the other hand, wake up everyday to a day of misery; constantly suffering while doing the same things as the day before.
  
The worst part about my situation is the feeling of nothingness. Wanting to strive for the better everyday but easily I give up. My mind and body have given up on me. I see everyone and everything through a blurry vision—and my mind is foggy, can’t comprehend the simplest things—everyday I struggle trying not to die

"Depressed, lonely, autistic, loser, anxious, unlovableHey guys and girls

I don't know where to start. There's so much but I feel really tired so I'll keep it short. I've been depressed since my father died and changed countries (I was 14, 9 years ago). At that point I pretty much lost everything I had except for my mother and I've never been really able to rebuild what I've had. I did shit in middle school didn't go for a year because I couldn't get out of bed.

Only the first year in high school was good. I had a girlfriend for a while. I thought I could rebuild what I had before but my new social circle was too different (from both me and my old one) and everyone in it ended up all growing apart. I couldn't deal with the workload in the second (8.30-17.30 day 4 to 5 times a week during the winter when we only have 3-4 hours of sunlight) and third year of high school. The third year wasn't that bad but I was burnt out from the second year and because of depression. The classes I had to retake ended up colliding with the ones I had to take for the third year.

After high school I pretty much lost all my friends I made there because I'm bad with people and generally very introverted. I also spent 2 years retaking classes I had missed from high school. It didn't take 2 years because there were that many classes. It took 2 years because I was too depressed to do anything and because I got really sick and to retake 2 of them.

I ended up getting into the uni I wanted to but the workload was too much for me to handle so I dropped out and wasted another year of my life. Now I got into another uni and I will start at the very end of august. I don't know how this will go. I'm really depressed and constantly tired. I've been really lonely all this time because I just can't make friends and because I can't deal with other people (ironic, no?) and many times need a lot of time for myself. This also makes it impossible to meet girls (not that it would make a difference). This anti-social aspect of my life has been getting worse and worse since about 2011. It's like my mild autism is getting worse, or that I can't keep up this facade where I try to fit in.

Recently it's been bothering me a lot that I haven't had sex with a girl in 8 years. This used to feel ""whatever there are worse things in life"" but recently I'm feeling really shit about it. Some days and some nights I can't stop thinking about sex and it makes me cry that I'm fucking retarded and nobody will never want me again. I've considered visiting a prostitute and have sex with her for a few hours but besides the fact I might catch a STD and that it's illegal and scary is that I don't want to be a person who pays to have sex. But I miss it so much and many of them are very attractive and it's really easy. I'm truly pathetic and a terrible excuse of a man.

I also feel there's something wrong with my thighs and some other weird health stuff which I've not told anyone about it. I don't know if it's serious or not but I guess this is another way of destroying myself without doing anything.

The only friends I have live far away from me. Honestly, I don't know if I'd still be friends with them if they lived close because I'm just so anti person and get anxious and what not.

I've contemplated suicide many times and now If I mess up uni again then I don't know what I'll do because then I've completely failed and I am an embarrassment for myself and my family. I'm just so sad that my life took such a bad turn and then I was too weak to do anything (especially during the days I didn't manage to get out of bed for weeks). I'm truly a loser in life and I don't deserve to be here. I'm broken and I can't be fixed. I'm just waiting until my mother passes away so she doesn't have to see me kill myself. I'm going to go cry again now.",suicidal,high

He still kept trying but I was clear from the start, I was only friends with him because I liked playing minecraft with him. He then proceeded to buy himself a rank and upgrade mine as well, this was entirely his own idea and choice. He then told me he spent all his money on me and STILL tried to get in a relationship with me of something?? No one forced you to spend $10 on a rank for me while I already had a rank and then try to guilttrap me because you spent reallife money on me.
I quit playing with him and we are no longer friends.

"I hate my father and my family. I hate my life, I hate me. I hate everything about me.Just a moment ago, my father said, ""Your brother is useless. He only knows how to earn money but is stingy. Wasted my time raising him up."" Then he looked at me and said, ""You'll be like him when you grow up. Useless, stingy, I can see what you'll turn to when you grow up. You're following your brother's footsteps. Kids are useless. You'll grow up to be a gangster like your brother and if I ever found you outside, I would slap your face infront of everyone. Being a gangster is like selling your vagina to people because you're a girl.""

Yes, that happened just now.. And unfortunately, it has happened more times than I could actually count.

My father is heavy-smoker who could finish up to a box of cigarettes in just a day. He complains about not having enough money, and ranted on and on when he would be rich, and when he could retire without worrying.

My family– Including my mother had enough of his money issues. He would loan money from people, saying, ""I'll pay you back when payday comes."" And he did, of course... But he'll do the same thing again, and again.

On certain days, he would scold me for no apparent reason, degrading me to a lower level. And I hate it. Furthermore, he compared me to my brother, saying I wouldn't 'help' ( always in terms of financial problems ) our family and that I'm useless and a good-for nothing who wasted his time, raising me up.

I would help my family, only if I could work– But being a fifteen-year-old, there are limited slots and spaces where I can really work. Besides, in Singapore, the employers would seek parents' consent for teenagers working ( and my parents never allow me; Saying I have to concentrate on my studies ). If I can just move in with someone else, I would.. But I don't know who would ever take in a fifteen-year-old as their dorm mate.. Including the fact that I'm still schooling.

I'm just sick of this. No one will hear me out, because I'm still 'young' and 'tender'. When something goes wrong, my father and older brother would point fingers at me, saying I'm in the wrong– Though in two views, we can be wrong, and I'm not the only one.

My brother frequently criticise me, scold me and would put all the blame on me, too. He would say, ""You're only pretty because you put on makeup.""

I'm good at pointing flaws on others, but even more, on mine. It's really hard, being a girl. My father and brother always discourage me from doing what I really want to do; To draw fashion ( even though, it's been my lifelong dream ).

I feel fat, and each time I look at the mirror, I hate myself.. More and more. I want to look good, I want to feel good, and I want to seek my freedom. I can never do it on my own, however..

I'm unhappy with 'me'. I want to be skinnier, I want to have a 23-inch waist, taller, smaller arms, smaller thighs.. Something that makes me feel feminine ( because that is my perspective of feminine ). Apart from that, I used to suffer from moderate acne and somehow, managed to heal most of my skin problems. I have very crooked teeth, sunken eyes.. And I'm unsure of what to do.

With my brother furthermore criticising my ugliness, I just wish there's a makeover.. Something that can really.. Make me feel proud, of myself. But I don't know what to do– And I don't have money.

The expectations my parents have for me as their female child and students makes me feel all the more worst about myself and my life. I'm only able to act as if I'm 'confident', even though I'm legit insecure as hell.",suicidal,high

"I have no will to liveI’m a mom of 4, mid divorce. My ex destroyed me. He spent 10 years sharing and posting my nudes (I had no idea) and talking to strangers about having them have sex with me and get me pregnant while he watched. He gave them info about me, shared my name and face. He also was on every dating and affair site, told women how shitty I was and how beautiful they were. When I found out I was a part time dance teacher and had just moved across the country from my family and friends. I had no career in place, no money, no place to go. I wanted to matter to someone, so I went along for a while, acted like it was cool. Finally when he started threatening me, I left. No one heard what he did to me, they heard that I slept around while married and I was instantly labeled morally fucked up. He told everyone I cheated, I left him, I kept the kids from him. Really, I continued bringing the kids to him while living in a hotel, them scared to death because he kept threatening me and acting violently. I had to. I was told I would lose them if I didn’t. But the custody reports still say I turned the kids against him and I’m morally corrupt.

I met someone. I fell in love with him. He’s married, but was trying the poly thing for his wife. His wife uses him. She travels the world to have her fun with various fwb and shops more than I’ve ever seen anyone shop in my life on his income, no job, no kids in the house. She orders him around and gave him zero affection. He treats me better than anyone else ever has, but he still hangs onto her in ways. They are separated now, but still live together, he doesn’t want to talk to a lawyer. They are still Facebook friends, still in text groups, still traveled together for Christmas and Thanksgiving while I was alone (my kids with their dad of course) though he says it was the last time and they didn’t even talk (it was for their adult kids). We’ve been together two years now, he’s been separated a few months officially, and he still won’t post pictures of us to Facebook. He said it was for his kids comfort, but his wife is always posting one of her many partners. I have to stay invisible.

I dont know what I’m doing in life. I can’t move in with family, can’t afford to live on my own as a dance teacher and any other job I’ve gotten costs more in child care than what I make. My family is paying my rent as I would otherwise be homeless. I’m trying to get a masters degree, in the process of applying. Still, that would be a couple years before I can  support myself and kids. 

My ex keeps acting intimidating, turning everything against me and  contacting professionals and telling them I’m taking the kids from him, etc. He makes a ton of money so he has the resources to have a bunch of professionals on his side and there is no justice in divorce. None. I have all the evidence that he even contacted someone who wanted to sexually enslave our underage daughter and literally no one has cared, not lawyers, not psychologists, not police, sheriff, women’s shelter, advocacy groups, no one. So my kids have to spend half their time with him and I have to stay here bordering on homeless fighting something that I don’t have the resources to fight while trying to work and go to school.

I’m exhausted. I feel like I’m hated by everyone. I’m judged by everyone. Everything I touch falls apart. I can’t keep fighting this. I want to be treated like I matter, but it just doesn’t happen. I don’t know how to go on.",suicidal,high

"I feel like the pressure is killing me, and I haven't even started yet.I’ll be frank from the outset: If I don’t pass my thesis defense I will kill myself. I’ve known this for months, but I think I’ve come to terms with it. And I’m so scared.

I haven’t slept in three days. I feel so helpless. 

Some brief background: If I pass my thesis defense, I’ll move to the other side of the continent to start a doctorate in August. The school I’m moving to is my top school, most of the program’s students graduate into the job I want to have. My cohort is full of tremendously intelligent, Ivy League types. I feel so outclassed and I haven’t even started yet. I was the first person in my family to graduate from college. I’ve clawed my way back from being a terrible, underprepared, and immature student in my first couple years of undergrad – for which I feel an enormous amount of shame – and (nearly) though a master’s in a new country. This is an opportunity that doesn’t come to people from where I grew up. I’m truly not trying to boast or talk myself up, I just want someone to read how hard it is for me to breathe with this much pressure.

If I fail my defense I’ll never start (or finish) a doctorate or publish any more papers. My doctoral offer, the fellowship, the reputation for which I’ve literally shed blood and tears all disappears. The thought of failing, of being exposed as a phony, of letting down my peers is worse than death. Because it’s more than my peers, my advisor, my colleagues; it’s my fucking career, it’s what I’ve devoted (zealously perhaps) myself to for (what feels like) my adult life. It isn’t that I have nothing if I fail, it’s that I have nothing to live for if I fail.

The sad thing is that I LOVE my work. It’s cliché (this whole situation feels so fucking cliché), but I wake up every morning with a genuine feeling of hope. Like I might accomplish something worthwhile. I hate myself for being so cynical.
I feel so trapped in my head. I want to smash my face into a pulp to stop the worrying so I can sleep again. To stop drinking so much. To stop alienating myself and be just vulnerable enough to live as a normal human being. I feel so pathetic and ungrateful and spoiled and melodramatic.

Killing myself will kill my mother. I know that. I can’t do that to her; she’s so proud of me. But I can’t live like this. I know this will only get worse – if I pass – as the stakes get higher. I feel so paper thin, like I’m living on a knife edge waiting to be squished into the blade. 

This is too much for me. Even if I do pass, I know I can't do this for much longer. Something has to give. If failure is inevitable why not prevent it altogether?

"Nobody knowsI am a 31 year old female.  And nobody knows that the only way I can stop crying long enough to fall asleep at night is to get myself blackout drunk all alone in my room.  Sometimes I resolve to end it all, and sit there on my bed with pills in hand or a knife at my wrists, but I cant do it.  

My parents were monsters.  They beat me, belittled and shamed me constantly, and kept me so sheltered that I wasnt even allowed to go see a movie with friends.  The pain of knowing my parents didnt love me, haunts me. 

I got married in 2002, and my husband changed the moment the ring hit his finger.  He wouldn't touch me.  He literally would build a pillow barricade between us at night so we couldnt touch.  If we had sex more than once every two months, it was alot.  I tried everything (lingere, toys, romantic dinners, etc), but he would just ignore me, and swat me off like a pesky fly.  Then I started catching him cheating.  It started out with me finding that he had been to dating websites, and escalated from there.  I caught him dozens of times.  And each time, it smashed my heart into a billion pieces.  I begged him to tell me why, but he could never come up with even one word of explanation.  I dont know why I stayed with him for over a decade.  I guess I loved him so much, I hoped he would change like he kept promising he would.  Plus I felt a little trapped because I had no money and nowhere to go.  I finally divorced him 2 years ago.  He still cant give me a reason for what he did.

After the divorce, I ran into a friend of my sister's that was also going through a divorce because his spouse had cheated.  We found it very therapeutic to talk about it together.  Feeling like we werent alone, and that someone else understood worked wonders for us.  Quickly, it turned into more.  For the next year and 1/2, I was in heaven.  He made me more happy than I could have imagined.  He called me every single day, made me feel like a real woman again, was the most easy going person I have ever met, made me laugh, and taught me how to trust and love again.  He was there for me no matter what (especially when I had brain surgery in August).  Things were GREAT, and getting better every day.  Then......out of nowhere he started disappearing.  He would come up with lame excuses as to why we couldnt hang out.  After the fourth week of this, I asked him what was going on. He told me that he had met someone and started dating.  I felt like someone had punched me in the stomach and ripped my heart out of my chest at the same time. I couldnt even speak.  When I started sobbing, he told me that he didnt know why I was so upset, since we had never been together (like as in a couple), and that I should have known we could never have a relationship because of the mutual friends we share.  

Ever since then, I cant stop crying (but only when I am alone......in the shower, driving, at night in my room, etc).  I cant eat.  I've lost a ton of weight. I cant sleep because I cant stop crying.  I cry so hard, that the pillow on either side of my head is soaked by 11:00 every night.  Sometimes, the pain is so bad, I scratch at my arms with my fingernails, or pull my hair to try to distract me from the pain in my heart. The people who I thought loved me the most, never cared about me at all.  And they didnt even care that they smashed my heart and left me broken.  Thats what keeps running through my head as I cry. They didnt even care about the anguish they caused me.  Nobody cares.  Nobody even offered to talk to me afterward.  

The only reason I havent killed myself to stop the horrible pain, is because I know my little boy would be devastated.  So I just keep drinking myself into an oblivion every night so that I can at least get some sleep and be able to function at work the next day. Even so, I am getting ever closer to killing myself, to make the pain stop.  I dont know what to do.",suicidal,high

So around 2-3am my dad opens my door and lets my dog in the bedroom I was half asleep and only heard that he was letting the dog sleep in my room. I woke up at around 6:30 to the sound of my dog peeing on the floor and not just the floor but all over my shoes as well and she also pee'd on my bed. at the time I'm posting this it is 7am and I'm on my sheetless pee stained bed with a plastic bag full of piss napkins on my floor and I'm not taking it out to the trash because I think there is a bear outside. I'm not even mad at my dog I'm just kind of mad at my dad.,normal,low

"How has your school experience with lockdown and COVID been? As March is approaching the realization that in about two weeks I will have achieved one full year of lockdown. I live in a third world country that was hit hard by COVID and frankly isn't gonna get better this year. Last year March the government temporarily shut down school as cases started popping up. So far, no schools in the city I live have resumed classes on campus. I have not seen my IRL friends since that day of school. As a lot of people have been experiencing, lack of motivation or even the desire to exist constantly building up and with the increasing pressure of college the stress load is quite high. I remember remarking that ""Online school will be so easy, it'd be hard to do poorly"". As fate may have it, the exact opposite turned out, for me and some of my classmates. How have your experiences been, are you back in class? Still online? Have you gotten the chance to see your friends?

Everyone is a trashy, no-good whore. My best friend is my dad, and now he’s fooling around. Won’t talk to me, only cares about illicit actions. We used to be so close. He loves his other daughter more than me. I want to kill him. Or myself. More of myself. 

I have schizophrenia and I’ve been spacing out all night. Seeing things- apparitions.

No one wants me, no one even cares to see me. My dad is breaking me apart. He was my only friend, now he wants to leave me. I feel as if I should kill someone. I want to slit my wrists. I can’t bare it.

I was bullied in high school. I had to become homeschooled. Then I recently went back to school, and was treated with so much love and kindness. But I was only there two months before graduation. I’m back to living my shallow isolated life with no one to hold or talk to. I want to go back to school.

I can’t make friends. Everyone hates me, talks behind my back. I’ve never been able to hold a friendship. I have a good online friend now, who I love dearly. But I feel I burden him.

I CANT GET A JOB, OR DRIVE. My parents forbid because I’m “disabled”

I want to be loved. The man I love is dead. I’ll never have him. I’ve only ever loved him. 

There’s no point for me to go on living. I should just end it here before things get worse, and they always get worse. I’ve never got peace.

"I just have to get this off my chest... TL DR at the bottom I'm very bad at writing stuff like this, so this might feel all over the place but read till the end.

I was born prematurely and was always sensitive about emotions back in the day. In this society being overly sensitive is a curse. I was quite an intelligent child in 1-5th grade and I never had to learn actually spend time learning. Because of this, I became a lazy kid and also due to my gaming addiction. This became my downfall. I started getting worse grades after 5th grade and I took these, way too seriously emotionally. I felt dumb but couldn't help it because I didn't want to spend time studying, but I suppressed these emotions so much that I was always happy on the surface but deep down I was a trainwreck. Whenever I performed badly in sports I always thought everything was my fault and I took it to my heart. But due to my emotion suppressing nobody knew (up to this day). I didn't like math because I've never had experienced success because I didn't want to study.

I've become an introvert because of this. As I was an only child my mother really loved (loves) me and she always bought clothes for me even when I was 14+, and my friends and classmates used to ""bully"" me for it. I never told anybody so this went on and on. The thing is now I've almost completely lost my ability to feel love. I don't even know what love is anymore. I don't even feel love for my parents or relatives anymore or at least I don't know if I feel it. After graduating from the gymnasium, I had enough points to get into a university where I learn to be a software engineer so at least I achieved something. Anyway, I've never had a girlfriend and I now don't want one because I don't think I need anyone to love me, and knowing this consciously is fucking depressing.

My friends and even my parents also asked if I was gay, and I didn't tell them ""no I'm just fucking empty inside and I don't truly love anyone"" and the worst thing is that I'm not actually depressed. I'm truly empty, I don't even know what I'm feeling as of writing this. So moral of the story if you are a gaming addict and a huge introvert then please shit on everyone's bad opinions whos doesn't matter. Set some personal goals for yourself and start working towards them.

TL;DR I suppressed my sad emotions so much when I was a kid that now I don't know what love is anymore despite being loved by others.",normal,low

"I'm invisible, irrelevant, may as well be a ghostA lady is texting asking what's wrong, I can talk about it. I know these days though this isn't true.

Just absolutely horrible horrible people like you wouldn't believe. And I try to get help, I try to get therapy, therapy only makes me feel worse though because yet again here I am opening up to someone who doesn't care and I hate that I cried once in front of a therapist and she just regarded me as a nuisance, I am not exaggerating in this regard. I don't know what to do anymore. Last time I was hospitalized I thought it was helping, but they left me hung out to dry, I was hoping they would help me connect to a therapist. I mean first day I was there I didn't get to speak to someone until 9:30 pm, I was all day, itching wishing I could talk to someone bc of some pretty horrific things that happened earlier that day, it was all day waiting. I mean and the in take also, I said I have a tendency to isolate myself - and she wrote down ""he says he isolates himself, but then he also says he has a roommate"" as though I were lying, as though I were making it up. I honestly don't ever talk to my roommate. I've seen him like 2 in the six months we've lived here. I can't believe that's how I get regarded when I try to get help. When I try to reach out, I feel so hopeless, I don't know who to turn to, I don't know where to turn to, I'm so fucking trapped, I'm so unimportant, it doesn't matter anyways to the rest of the world and that is what gets me the most, I know the world will continue on unchanged if I went away, not even my family knows me, they know nothing about me. I don't know what to do anymore. I'm so lost. This is a complete nightmare. I feel like I'm in Hell. How can things get this nightmarish. I don't want to commit suicide.

"Have a plan, don’t have courage?It’s quite tough to put my thoughts all together, but maybe that’s the way to move it somehow. Since a long time I’ve been struggling with intrusive suicidal thoughts, what’s sometimes connected with more concrete plans, sometimes not. Of course in between there were a lot of periods where it wasn’t so bad, but I don’t feel saying it was good is okay.

I’m having a very good life, at least from the other’s people perspective. Good job in a cool place, nice living conditions, one could say I shouldn’t complain at all. But I feel since quite some time something is going wrong with me and I can’t bear it anymore. There is nothing very specific in my mind right now, that’s why it overwhelms me so much. Knowing exactly what’s the problem, I would just try to solve it. But I’ve been doing it for so long and just don’t feel it makes any sense anymore to try to chase this.

I’m not sure if I’m writing this as a call for help or just to let you know I have a plan. I tried to reach out for help, but I’m not from this kind of people having hundreds of friends everywhere.  I have a few of them spread across Europe, but only one in my neighbourhood. I had more, but at some point my behaviour was wrong and some of my relationships were just buried. My family also lives quite far away what makes our contacts more difficult. I really wanted to get some specialist’s help when I felt it still made sense but didn’t have enough courage to do this on my own. My friend rather ignored the fact I asked for help with reaching out someone, so I fixed my mind to thoughts it just don’t make sense and I should try to deal with it on my own.

Right now I just don’t feel anything. Last days were really tough for me, yesterday I went for a day trip, going out of town always helped me when I felt like my existence makes no real sense. I’m calling it ""emergency trips"". But it doesn’t help anymore. I don’t feel neither good nor bad things, it’s just nothing in my mind. Whatever happens, it has no impact on me.

The plan is simple, but the simpler, the better. Just a bridge. I should call the emergency to tell them there is something strange happening, but they can’t know I’m calling on myself. Otherwise, for sure they will try do discourage me. I don’t think I will cause much trouble to the people after that, for sure not more than I do now. I don’t even feel it will make a difference to many people around me. Probably for some of them it will even make everything better. Last days I cleaned up all my open projects so it will be as easy as possible for people to keep going. I don’t think there is anything else I can do to minimize the consequences.

I have no idea why I’m really writing this. Sorry for keeping it so long, I just wanted to put in here everything I was thinking about. Thanks and take care?",suicidal,high

"I was going to commit suicide thursdayWell there are many reasons i was going to do it. Really it was a rough point in my life. I am seventeen guy btw.

Mainly i haven't been feeling the best around these days idk what it is. Stress maybe? Maybe i am just another spolied teen. whatever it was i dont like doing school work and i have been coasting along on c's. Well i didnt do a project for school and was going to do it after it was due except the fact my teacher decided to call my parents. Well knowing full well my parents were going to ground me because not only did i get an F in english but the week before i crashed the car into a ditch. Wasn't too big of damage but my parents were still angry of course. i fuck up way too much lately. 

So I went back to my seat and just thought of ways to kill myself. I really dont know why my first thoughts was killing myself. Its not like my life is shitty. I have lots of friends, i smoke weed when i want, and i am pretty creative i think. I knew how to plan it too my suicide that is. I really was going to do it too. I was gonna use vicoden and some rum in the basement. I had it all out while my parents went for a walk. But i didnt do it, i just put it back. 

Idk whats what right now. i really dont want to do it but i am still just kinda whatever if i do. 

my friend didnt even know how depressed i was yesterday and he sent me [this](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2yeNzL7rTU&amp;feature=related) just because of the song kinda made my spirits go up a little

"Finding the will to liveXpost from /r/depression

I feel very selfish for the way i've been feeling, but for the last couple of months I've been having suicidal thoughts to the point where I've formulated a plan and I've been getting my affairs in order, changing suppliers for my fiance so that the household bills are the most cost effective, throwing away personal possessions I don't care about, ""packing away"" things I won't be using.

I had a date in mind and I've just been living day to day until this day comes, experiencing life a bit, pushing through some of my personal boundaries, YOLOing it basically.
This week I've actually started to think that perhaps there's something to live for and this has stumped me but is giving me hope.

**Story Time**I had an abusive upbringing which led me to a suicide attempt in my teens, I failed but since then I've always had this nagging feeling in my brain when life gets shit that perhaps that is the answer and occasionally I'll fantasise about jumping in front of cars or drowning myself but never really do it.

Fast forward a few years I learn to cope with my depression and anxiety, I move far away from my abuser so anxiety of them being just around the corner is diminished. I have a generally positive outlook on life and feel secure and safe. I get engaged to the man of my dreams, we are together for 6 years and it's all wonderful.

Fast forward to about 6 months ago and I find out that my Fiance had a 1 night stand with one of my best friends, in my house no less, whilst I was sleeping. I forgive it as a mistake, the friend is still madly in love with him so that was awkward but for me personally my world crashed down. I'm afraid when I'm alone in the streets that someone is around the corner ready to kidnap me (a fear I used to have when I left my abuser), I'm depressed, feel worthless and confused. The only thing that drives me day by day is the fact that I need to do the given tasks. I basically wake up to go to sleep, I work ridiculous hours at work, staying away lots and just drinking and generally crying to myself in my hotel rooms when I'm away travelling with work.

I've hidden a lot of these deep feelings of depression from my partner as I don't want him to feel too guilty for what he did, the affair was a stupid mistake. I just put on a brave face when I'm at home.
For the last couple of months I've had a bit of an existential crisis. What even is the point of living? TO do the next task and the next task? Why not just cut to the chase? From a logical perspective it makes sense. I have no real desire to live so it doesn't matter if I die in my mid 20's or my late 90's.

And then something happened this week, I just felt warmth. I've been ""playing"" at life for weeks now whilst getting my bits in order and I thought, I'm really going to miss this guy, I'm really going to miss my friends, I'm going to miss sunshine and music, sunflowers and cabbages. I'm going to miss sand between my toes and crisp winter mornings. Maybe the reason I should live is just because *I want to*.

Perhaps one day I'll get back to the stage where I plan it all again, choose a fair date, when the lease on our apartment is up and theres no special occasions near by. But for today I'm going to enjoy the little things in life, maybe even make it to my wedding day and find some more reasons to carry on.
Sorry if that was a bit jumbled, I'm tired and emotionally drained atm :D",suicidal,high
"Just another one unable to cope with lifeSo, the thing about 'having depression' for me is, I never knew about it. I always felt this way and I don't remember anything else - which includes that I have completely forgotten everything that happened in my life prior to puberty.
One of the earliest memories that I have now is, when I was something around 13. I do remember that at that time all the other children in school were hanging out with each other, except for me. I was too shy to ever do anything about it so I usually hung out alone here.
Thats over 10 years in the past now. Except for about 400 consecutive days where I felt good about myself because I wasn't alone anymore, I've always contemplated suicide, every day. I made plans that I eventually threw away, because all of them involved not being a wimp and actually be determined and finally end myself. Sadly up to this day I wasn't up for the task.
Anyway, something - for me - rather impactful happened at the very beginning of this year which put me into another crisis and finally got me to open up to one of the very few friends I have. Turned out to be a mistake unfortunately, since he straight up went to my parents and told them about it. They convinced me to get counseling and medical therapy, which started by the end of january.
So now, after 9 month of weekly appointments with my therapists and taking antidepressants I am more convinced than ever that those things are not helpful at all. It's making things even worse because it's a huge waste of time and also I feel terrible everytime I have to talk about the reasons because its basically just a regular reminder pf why I hate being alive.
Last week I ditched my therpist and I stopped taking the antidepressants. I know you shouldn't do that but I feel like that was the best thing to do. I finally feel like I could accomplish a fatal task.
I made a new friend at the University who also deals with depression. She copes with it my cutting herself in places where no one sees. Alas, she didn't mean to give tips but she *accidentally* did anyway so I started doing it to. I don't even think I have it under control. It's just happening when I can't deal with life for a moment.
Another thing that I kinda lost control of is Marijuana abuse. I know it's not a serious drug but in the past I smoked one or two at the weekend just to relax but for a few months now, I consume at least 1 gram a day. As soon as the effect fades away I immediately start feeling bad about myself and everything again so I take the next hit.
This whole text is pretty badly structured and probably incomprehensive and I doubt that anyone actually cares, but I had to get this out there.
To get to the core of the problem, I hate living this live without anyone in existence caring enough to show genuine love for me. I'm gomma stay alone forever, there is no way around it. There is no medication in the world that can change the fact that there is nothing desirable about me and no one would ever want to be with me.
Antidepressants won't help with this, neither will therapy. I said that before but after trying it out and seriosly trying to make it work, I noticed I was correct all along. Tell me, what am I supposed to do now, except for killing myself? I often get lost in thoughts when driving so maybe finally in the next few days this will be over. Until then I am grateful for any advice you can give.

"I don't make a lot of sense.I'd always thought about suicide. As a kid I even checked out a book about self harm from the junior high library. I was curious. I didn't understand why I got the impulses I did, a tad stronger I'd say than the typical intrusive thoughts we're mostly all familiar with. 

In highschool, I bought sleeping pills. I kept them in a box under my bed and waited, wondering when I'd use them. My mom kept a bottle of tequila in her closet. I threw them out when I got to college. After I'd taken two. 

The impulses got stronger. The intentions more sincere. I dissuaded myself with logical arguments, that if I offed myself now, my parents would have to pick up my slack for student loans left unpaid, and that wasn't fair. So I'd stay alive to pay my debts to society. That's what a good little girl does. 

After college I got a job. And then another. And then a third. I worked myself ragged. I still made less money than my sister makes part time. She has a degree that's worth something. I don't.

I usually think about crashing my car. It'd be the easiest, most obvious solution. I drive a lot, to near and far places and not always a regular route, in all kinds of weather. This past winter was exceptionally tempting. It'd be easy to write off a car hitting a pole and killing the driver as a slip on the ice, as losing control. Other times it's simply a windy way. How easy would it be to just not turn the wheel and drive off the hill, into a tree, a pole, a wall. Even if it didn't kill me, maybe it would shock me back to life. There are times when, despite everything else, I truly feel vibrant and beautiful - and then I always descend from that parapet in a devastating swoon of deprecation. 

Sometimes I overreact. Something small happens and I can't help but take it so deeply to heart I implode, despite a voice in the back of my head screaming at me to stop it, stop making such a fool of yourself, stop acting like a child. There's no need to cry over a broken plate, no need to go catatonic at a misuse of words or a joke. Nobody means it. The plate is replaceable. My feelings needn't be hurt so easily, but they are. I can't help it. 

I tried talking to my mom. She thinks my emotions are a choice. Why do I get so worked up, she wonders, when I have an uncontrollable episode over something as minor as getting my key stuck in the door. She thinks that my scars were a silly attempt to gain her attention. I first told her about them when I was twenty. Some of the oldest were from when I was twelve. If I had wanted her attention, I must have failed pretty badly at it for her to ignore the (what I thought was) obvious for eight years. But it's not her fault. It really isn't. 

I tried talking to my sister, too. She placates me with my two-year-old niece, who was diagnosed with severe autism. She needs her aunt, my sister says, and no matter how bad we think our lives are, they can't be worse than hers. I don't think that's a fair comparison. I could be wrong.

I talked to my boyfriend initially, but I've weaned him off my distress. I hate to see him so upset. He doesn't understand, and that frustrates him. I can't stand to see him cry. It's too unfair. He doesn't deserve to suffer my unhappiness. 

I'm not sure what I'm even talking about anymore. I just feel like there's no one left to talk to. I've always thought about getting a giant phoenix tattooed on my back. Outwardly, I've told people that it was because I loved the idea of a phoenix, constantly being reborn. Inwardly, I knew it was because I was fascinated with the choice of a Phoenix to sacrifice its current life for a new one, although I'm sure some will argue the aspect of 'choice'. For me, it'd be the choice to transcend the fate I had always thought I had, and to embrace the world for all it is, its terrors and wonders, its fretful endeavors and vivacious adventures. It'd mark my choice to be reborn, in life or in death.   

I just worry that, when the numbers break even, I won't have an argument left to put off what I feel is inevitable. I don't want to be a wayward spirit chained to a life she views as a waste. But I do want to live. I just don't see how. ",suicidal,high

I don’t know what I’m going to do, it’s making me want to die.I’ve suffered from BDD for a year now, it started when I lost quite a bit of weight and ever since I have been obsessed over how my body looks. I hate my legs, my hips and my thighs so much. I pinch at them until they’re sore and will spend hours every week just staring at them, trying so hard to convince myself I’m skinny. I hate it. People tell me I am slim and that what I’m seeing isn’t right, but I can’t see myself any other way. I just want to be like the others girls my age, they’re all so thin and tall and look like models, and I’m just here all chubby and short and sad. I’m so jealous of my friends, they’re all so much thinner and taller than me yet talk about how they need to lose weight to fit in their prom dress. It makes me feel ashamed of myself — I feel bad enough because I know I stress my mum out a lot with my condition. She gets nervous and I know she really wants me to like my body. I feel awful that I despise it. Whenever I think about it, all I want to do is curl up and die. I stopped self harming when I was 13; I was bullied when I first went into secondary school, luckily I’ve grown out of that. I was happy for so long and I’ve fallen back flat again.

"I am in no way planning suicide.I say this for legal purposes and so that there is no misunderstanding, and also because it is the truth.

I do not plan on any harm to myself or anyone else.

I will say this much.  If I wanted to take my own life, I would feel it was my right.

I would feel resentment towards our present system for forcing people into a situation where they can be detained without trial. 

At a minimum it's unconstitutional and barbaric.

If I wanted to commit suicide, I also would have arrived at that decision because of the mistreatment inflicted upon me by others.

Some of those ""others"" in question being the moderators of this exact subs sister subs.

There's nothing worse than knowing the troll who trolled you, and got their friends to troll you, is the same troll who you'd have to rely on for comfort...if you decided you didn't want to go on.

I've been abused by the mental health system.  Once is enough.  I don't intend to have it happen again.

My life is dedicated to fighting against psychiatry..and part of the reason I fight against psychiatry is to prevent rape.

I also want to say for the record that I am furious and offended as hell that there are mods in r/rape who are trolls, and who are pro psychiatry and direct people to get psychiatric help...when in reality one in four women who are forced into psychiatric situations wind up being raped.

Some are raped by the same psychiatrist that is supposed to be helping them to get by.

One of the things I personally survived..that has taken me four years to talk about..was being trolled on line.

Being involuntarily committed.

And then being face to face with my online trolls as a result.

And having no one believe me that it happened.

For people to say ""Get help"" is like more gas lighting.

I don't know how they can say such an awful and inexcusable thing to me.

If I weren't so strong I would have wanted to commit suicide.

I would have become like other people who are not as amaizing as I am.

I would have become a TI like Myron May.

Instead I am a TI maybe more like Tim Tresspass, or Sharon Poet.

As a TI, please consider, the causes of rape and suicide may be the very things that are there to allegedly prevent it.

Look close to home if you are looking for some of the problems.

Look at how your nursing staff, or your intake physicians treat your suicidal clientele.

Ask yourselves why you have repeat customers.

For the record, and for legal purposes let me repeat.  I am in no way a danger to myself or anyone else.

"Not sure what to title thisI’m not even sure where to start with this. I was raised with abuse in one arm and secrecy in the other. My sister and I were molested by an older cousin who lived with us, babysat us. My brain was too young to retain what happened, so it repressed the memory until I was 11 years old, the year I got my period. I didn’t tell my mother or anyone else I got my period. I did not tell anyone what I remembered happening to me. For years I had to eat Thanksgiving dinner, and Open Christmas presents but my molester in the same room. And what hurt was everyone knew he was a pedophile. 

After he moved out of our house he molested another cousin who was mentally disabled and he went to jail. Still, he was allowed back among us, with not a word said to those of us who had been molested. And it was not a secret, people put two and two together. 
But I was still in the arm of secrecy. I didn’t know he sexually abused my sister as well, because in the solitary memory that surfaced in my mind, I was alone. I didn’t learn that she too was a victim until I was 16. And you have to understand, the relationship I had with my sister was one of vitriol and fear. 

She seemed to loathe everything I was. The way I walked was too manly, the way I dressed was too sloppy, the way I wore my hair and the way I ate and the things I liked and it seemed I was the bane, the very miserable bane of her existence. She would sit and poke and prod at everything she knew made me vulnerable. I was overweight. My mother put a relaxer on my hair and it all fell out: I was bald. At that point social anxiety had forced me deeper and deeper into my room, into books away from friends and activities, away from the outside world. My sister saw all these things and jumped on them with glee. 

What did I have? She was popular. Pretty. Boys liked her. She was a track star and a debate queen and had excellent grades and always had a place to be and friends to be with and I was her fat slob of a sister who no one could quite remember the name of or when they had even seen me last. I idolized my sister. I hated my sister. I hated myself. I began to fantasize about hurting myself, I began to cut tiny symmetrical lines into my skin, I cried myself to sleep every night. 

I couldn’t possibly describe the cold calculation of my mother because I’m still holding onto a version of her that is golden haired and warm and smells like petuli and fresh earth and would kill and go to the ends of the earth for me. But she watched my sister destroy me in silence, only butting in when I lost control and began screaming curse words, which would elicit a wry smile from my sister, “you’re just gonna let her talk to me like that?” She asks my mom and I flee to my bedroom, always fleeing, always retreating. 

My mother would comment later, “ I watch her push all your buttons, trying to get a reaction out of you. I see what’s happening.”

Inside I scream, “Then help me! Can’t you see I’m drowning! I’m fighting for my life, please help me!” 

But there is silence. I say nothing. Always, I say nothing. I would dream about feeling safe and loved and wanted, and it seemed to me the only way I’d get that from my mother and sister was if I was hurt or sick. I fantasized about falling into comas, getting sick, and eventually just being dead. 

I remember a passage from the Bible said “there aren’t enough books in the world the fill with all the shit Jesus did” and it’s hyperbole obviously, but it registers with me. This was nothing, honestly the tame parts of my life. Things got different for me after Covid because I had a breakdown right before, and fuck it felt like everyone, absolutely EVERYONE failed me, either for selfish reasons, or because I simply didn’t matter enough and I realized that this really is a dog eat dog world. The hatred my sister and mother had for me, even if it wasn’t about me, was real. It’s not really about me. It was about the same fear I felt, masked as hatred.

There hasn’t been a day that’s gone by for as long as I can remember that I haven’t thought about death, about the sling of existential dread that hangs from my throat, about how all the awful things that happened to me, that happened to my mother and my sister and my grand mother and everyone of my ancestors could happen to me at any time, anywhere. That being a woman makes me vulnerable but being a black woman somehow makes me less vulnerable? when truly it’s the absolute opposite, I am more vulnerable. I am so vulnerable that daily I consider if dying would be a better choice that putting myself out in the world where white men and women can exploit and monetize my body and black men can release their rage on it. I have to exist in that impossible interim and be a good little black girl, don’t complain or else I’m an angry black women and no one finds them attractive, right? And if I don't have my attraction then what do I have? 

I put this in this particular subreddit, because even though I’m a black non-binary person with borderline personality disorder (there’s lots of subreddits  to air my shit) it is my struggle with finding the point in living another day that consumes me.",suicidal,high

"Indecisive about major life decisionI have just finished college with a bachelors degree in electrical and computer engineering. I have a loving boyfriend and am in a very serious 1+ year relationship in which we live together. Our relationship has recently been through some external trauma, in the form of a person stalking me and sending me very obsessive sexual letters. This is over now, but I really should go to a psychiatrist about this. I am worried about this experience negatively affecting the relationship, as if it has ""ruined"" our life situations and affected my perception of my boyfriend (seeing my boyfriend sometimes reminds me of the trauma). I am between jobs, but have received an offer from a local company with excellent benefits. It is slightly low paying for my niche. Before getting the job offer, I had been considering packing up everything and moving across the country to start a new life, in the silicon valley area. I had been considering this because of the excellent job market for my major, and the amount of opportunities there for someone in my field, in comparison to my current city, which is oversaturated with qualified people. I have enough money in savings to do this and have a 6-9 month financial padding, but I don't have a job offer. I have multiple engineering and non-engineering friends in the area, since I have lived there before. I have been wanting to start a new life as a result of this trauma, and the surroundings in the area reminding me of it, in addition to more opportunities. The day before receiving the offer at the company, I signed a 3 month sublease in the silicon valley area, and paid the security deposit. This lease is assuming that I would leave by next Monday for the Silicon Valley Area. I have talked to my boyfriend about this, and he has been mature, recognizing all of the issues involved, but it is possible this has damaged our relationship because he might feel that our relationship is not ""permanent"". My boyfriend cannot come because of a custody issue with his son, even though he would if he could. I have been having a feeling of being ""tied down"" here and before getting the job offer, felt that I may grow to resent my partners inability to move. I'm not really sure which decision to make here. I usually think about it for a few hours while he is at work and come to the conclusion to move, but when he is here I come to the conclusion to stay. I want someone objective to provide me with advice.

I'm happy, but im sad.

This may seem strange to several of you.

""You have no right to be sad, your life is good."" you might say, but i really am sad.

I shouldnt be sad. But i am.

I have a good, loving wife; 2 beautiful children and a third one on the way that excites my as much as it scares me.

I have a great, high paying job that i love. I construct something out of nothing as a software developer. I have produced numerous software that help save lives every day. I truly am proud of my work. Although I shouldn't be sad, I am.

As a 27 year old i have achieved more then most will in their lifetime. I had a long ""Bucket list"" that is almost finished, only a handfull left to cross off. Yet, i cant shake the desolation.

I have a good loving happy family. I have good friends, good coworkers and even my neighbors are fantastic. Yet, i'm sad.

For the last 8 years of my life i have not had a single day that the ""thought"" has not come to my mind. Thoughts like: that building looks tall, there's some corrosive acid, that rope seems long enough, that knive looks sharp; thoughts that have no place in a happy soul's mind.

I'm afraid. Afraid of the feral beast my mind is. The fractious beast seems indecisive about what is and what should be. Afraid of it taking control, leading me to the nadir of my depression and acting accordingly.

I fear the worst. I fear being consumed by an abyss of misery and melancholy. Magnetized to the enticement of self damage.

I have raught out for professional help, only to return the same. Their approach doesn't seem to remedy my thoughts or guide my mind.

It seems that you are the ears that listen. The congregation that cares.

It began when my brother got angry at him for picking him up for a mistake he made while talking to my dad (me and him do it alot to each other). Then my friend text to say they had found the love of their life and I was super happy for them. Then my brother and dad kept trying to cast a video of me to the TV even though I kept asking them not to.

They then both said they weren't very happy with me so I decided to go to bed early. My dad said that if I went early I couldn't go on my phone and I basically just said to him that I can do what I like and he can't stop me.

"Basically summary of all my struggles and fears. (warning, long).Several years ago, I was just at a breaking point. I snapped. I had contemplated for months, but that evening it was just different. I left the party me and my family attended earlier and went home, put on my favorite piece of music and basically tried to make my piece with everything before committing to my attempt... I was raised in a religious family and I prayed for it to happen quickly, painless and foremost... to happen at all.
But it did not.
A few hours later my family came home and it woke me up. I knew my window has passed, I would not have the strength to do it with them meters away from me.
I was incredibly frustrated at first, but then, as it is my way, i thought everything through again and again. Over the next few months the fears that pushed me towards that moment had resolved, or at least they did not invoke the same panic as before.
I came to believe, the god I had prayed to to make it happen, held me back, kept me here for some reason. My relationship with my belief grew strong and a huge source of hope and strenght. And the song I listened to that evening, became a sort of hymn for said trust, since I believed he saved me that night.

Over the next months I recovered and grew more optimistic. I started to enjoy being with myself and my thoughts. Time to think felt like i could advance with all the problems I had and I would solve the dilemmas, in which I saw myself constantly, one after one.

One day I stumbled upon a piece of music and it touched me on a whole other level, never experienced before...
I swore myself: You will never listen to that song, until 1.: You find the one waiting for you. (yes I am some kind of superstitious weirdo, believing in god and „the one, true, love“) or... 2.: Should you EVER want to end your life yourself again.
That way, I would not be able to commit anything without remembering what I thought I was ultimately living and waiting for.

Up to this day, I have not listened to the song again. And it always has been a perfect hurdle for every suicidal thought, toppling them the moment they emerged from the subconscious... at least that is what it used to be.
For months I have lost a lot of the connection to my belief.
For months now I can not stand myself. Can not be alone with my own thoughts.
I can be happy temporarily, but as soon as the moment subsides an emptiness and a gnawing feeling takes its place.

One of the few things that can numb this are video games. I dont think of anything while playing, which is a perfect break from all the self loathing. But the amount of people, that can manage the same thing has decreased drastically... making the gaming all the more important.

I dont know, what happened, why I can not stand myself anymore.
I dont know why all my thoughts turned dark and void.
I dont know why my friends and loving family can not make me feel wanted.

I am not alone, more like the opposite, but I am incredibly lonely.
And for some time now, I have lost the energy to even play games.

My only refuge from myself is gone.

I am inching closer and closer to listening to the song... I want to hear it so badly. I crave someone who I can share my most inner nature with. Someone who will mend me, like in the stories. But I have almost given up.

The promise I gave my mother all the years ago, after I told her about the incident, does not feel binding anymore.
The god that saved me last time, might not be able to do it again.
The song is what keeps me alive at the moment I am afraid.

And I am afraid.
Terrified of what might happen should I snap again.
Put on the song again and live the bad ending of the story I thought out back then... not thinking the dark ending was possible. I was there to make the bright ending a triumph. Worth the wait.

I dont know when it might happen.
Or at all?
I think that is the reason why I wrote the post. To make it clear to myself. How close I am to the breaking point.

I am not that naive anymore. I do not have another attempt that will be spoiled by naive lack of knowledge of anatomy.

I am terrified and afraid. Not sure who to turn to. I do not know if or when it will happen. I cant connect to any of my family or friends for them to help me...

I hope I can find a solution, before my strenght breaks.",suicidal,high

"Question - Has anyone else struggled with wanting to 'check out' for decades (38m)?22 years after my first diagnosis of major depression, and only recently (prior two months) has it become completely debilitating. It feels like the normalcy I thought I felt as a high-functioning major depressive maybe never was. I'm panicking almost non-stop about fixing everything that's wrong. The pain comes in waves and at seemingly random intervals. This time around it's a flood of disaster, the details of which are too long and uninteresting to mention here. A happy ending in life is no guarantee after all, eh?

Today I'll pick a date, pick a method, and write a note. My legal and financial affairs are in order.  
If nothing else, I'll then stop unfairly burdening the one and only person who still believes in me. I know it's painfully hard for her to see me this way and she deserves better after all the awful things that life has done to her.

Star football player in high school, came from a good family, played college football, had tons of friends, got most girls.. seemingly had it all. He drank a lot, but always acted so upbeat and happy. Was so easy to make friends with, super outgoing, the whole nine. He must know how many people loved him and yet he still felt something inside that was eating away at him every day.

Final Words


Hi. I don’t know what else to really say right since this is something that I thought I wouldn't write again. But if you’re reading this, I’m sorry. I’m sorry for the pain that this will surely cause many. I’m sorry for failing because I wasn’t trying hard enough, even though I was doing everything I could. I’m sorry to my friends because they always wanted to help me, and yet this is how I’ve repaid them. I’m sorry to my parents because I don’t feel like I’ll ever really amount to anything. I just can’t feel anything. At this point, I’m just an empty shell, soulless, emotionless, sad. Will this leave a hole in the family? Yes, probably. Will this make everyone who knew me inconsolably sad? Yes, and for this, I am so sorry. The last thing I wanted was to spread the pain that I felt onto others. But I’m too blind to find any other solution to this pain. I’ve heard a certain quote many times when talking to others about my feelings: ”Death is a permanent solution to a temporary problem.” But for some reason, I can’t convince myself that it's temporary. So, I’m choosing stick with a quote that I like more: ”I’m here for a good time, not a long time.”",suicidal,high

"I don't want help, I want to die.Suicide is  like the natural selecton for the mentally distressed, the ones that are strong enough to overcome do so, and the ones that not, don't live enough to reproduce. Life finds a way.

Hi, my name is X, I am about 20 years old, and this could have been about my 12th post in this site if I hadn't scrapped all of the previous ones before; regardless if anyone will read this or not, I want to have it somewhere before I choose the irriversible. I was born on a third world country, priviledged enough to be considered middle class, comfortable but not luxurious. I grew up with my grandparents and my mother, almost half of the time with each group, due to the ladder having to work all day in under the minimum wage paying jobs. As I stated, we had a comfortable way of living. We never ran out of food or water, had internet, tv, and could afford to buy nutella or a pizza once in a while, thanks to my mother's savings. I didn't need any other material possesion. My mother was someone with a really short temper and a severe untreated depression, as all the other characters in this tale, she would often get mad for miniscule things and  loose her mind while screaming and saying whatever went into her mind, to later (sometimes) regret the reaction and truthufly apologize. She has worked on that all this years, and I can say that at least today she is doing well, learning to control it, and more calm than I have ever seen her. On the other hand, there is my grandparents, the female, GM, who is a verbally abusive and emotionally manipulative woman, and the male, GF, who is a submissive and passive agressive judger, and not the problem here.  Growing up I learnt, since a pretty early age, that being the first granddaughter to be born (My oldest cousin is four  three younger) I was taking the place of not only ""Grandma's spoiled little girl"", but also the exange token. Fights were, and are, a common thing in my family. Family gatherings are a call for disaster, as there hasnt been a single one, without exageration, in which we have walked off without someone having fought with someone else. And yet, for some unknown reason that I have yet to understand, they keep doing them as soon as the fumes of the last fight go down. Going back to the token status. Each time my mother and GM fought, I would usually be taken away my grandparents for her to blackmail them. ""You´re not gonna see X until you do this or that"" ""X can't love someone that did this or that to us"". and then proceed to cry to me everything my GM has done to her in the past, including but not limited to ruining her academic opportunities, and making her life miserable. Then, once everything was over, be forced to stay some weekends with them , and deal with my GM crap about ""how much they love me"" ""how unreasonable my mother was being by keeping me away"" ""how much they were hurt because of my 'horrible' mother"" and that ""if she does something to you call us and you come to live with us"". I, for that matter, could see trough all of their bullshit. I wasn't naive in that aspect, and could easly see what they were trying to achieve.  But this, again, wasn´t the problem.

While I grew in a partially religious household, I became an atheist from an early age, in such a natural manner as a kid stops believing in santa or the thoot fairy, but at the time I didn't had a term for it. I was an exellence student, almost all my shcool history having full A+ in my grades, and strong relationships with my tutors (I still talk to some of my highschool professors, as we used back on the day, on intellectual or scientific conversations), almost every time won in any contest I participated, developed mental and motor skills at an early age, and had been born under a lucky star (as far as we ignore my family's long history of mental disease). I was a trophy child. Everyone in my close family would held me to high standards, and as I didn´t liked to underpeform, I pushed myself beyond limits since kid. They loved to brag about me at family reunions, workmates, or complete strangers, while not giving a crap about I was doing other than for social proposes. They showed me to the world, scolded me for missing a few things, and shoved me cak into the crystal cabinet to wait until they wanted to tell everyone ""I did this kid"" again. Lowering my grade by a tiny fraction would make them mad, getting sick of them and daring to respond to them would give me a week long scold, I had to go trough months of punishment (say, half a year without using the internet, and no, Im not exagerating, and even once I was forced to use all my summer vacations to read trough three 700 page budhist books and make resumees of them for my mother before I could think of touching any electronic device), and they never stopped complaining about my weight. And no, I am not fat. I am rougly over 2kg of my recommeded weight, which can't be physycally seen, even with close examination, but I´ve never been an underweight person, as GM always wished for me to. Im also not the most femenine thing out there, as GM would desire, I just don´t stick to archetypes, not because I want to be ""rebellious"" or ""according"" to society or any social movement, I don't do those kinds of politics. I like videogames (From Terraria to Xcom, the saga of the Age games, and most puzzle ones) and books (The Praise of Folly by Erasmus of Rotterdam is my favorite), have written tales since I learnt to write, and poetry since I was 14, but well, none of that matters, and I am a passionate D&amp;D player.

During this early years I developed some paranoidal behaviours that I still have, such as screaming in tears to a random corner in my room, to that ""invisible man I know is watching me"", to leave me alone. Other times I would cover anything with eyes (portraits or plusheies) with a blanket, as I utterly and unreasonably feared they were watching me. I would lock my doors and windows, even in the hottest of days (we've reached temperatures of 50+C or 120+F, which is halfway boiling point of water), and design clever noise traps and mechanisms to wake me up on the slightest disturbance. I caught my grandparents watching me over the windown a couple of times at about 2am, but nothing else. I stopped locking my doors so bady some months ago, and I no longer scream at the misterious invisible man, but have the constant and pressing feeling of being watched, whataver I do, wherever I am, usually pressing feelings of excessive guilt when Im not being productive. I also developed a severe anxiety, and a quick down on self esteem. I learnt to ""hear"" my family´s emotions trough the sound they made, their footsteps, the speed they parked with, how they opened the door, how long did they took to greet, and sublte voice and movement variations. I started to live with the constant feeling I did something wrong, as each time any would see something I made, either my grades, my weight, or productiviness, I would only receive complains. If I cleaned all the house without being asked for, I would get a ""You didn´t clean here"" before a ""Thank you"", if one ever came, so each time they talked to me, each time they went even close to my bedroom, I'd get really anxious and started to ask myself ""What did I do wrong?"". Similar to a kid that knows they took those cookies last night and is being asked about it, but with the difference it was all the time. 

And yet, that still isn´t the problem.

I had severe problems with anxiety and self esteem, and then the pressure started to slowly climb on me, I started to drown in expectations, and I felt responsable and obligated to fullfil them. I had to be the smartest, I had to be the most responsable, I had to be the best. (From this was born the famous phrase of one of my roleplaying games: ""Almost is never enough, almost has never be enough.""). I did not let down for a ehile, but then, as my teen age approached, I got lazier, and tired of it. Grades dropped, problems rose, and time and time again the only thing that happened was my anxiety getting worse, and my self esteem going lower. When I got to highschool everything ended up falling into pieces. I never got along well with girls, as females this age are quite peculiar beings, and while trying to find a group of boys that would accept me I got involved with the wrong people, which ocassionaly hited me and verbally abused me. I remember that from them I had to occasionally ignore their comments on the ""kind of things they would like to do"". After a year with this people, I got involved in my first ever fist fight, I won, and had such resentment that tried to move in with the group of boys that had some kind of ""enemy relation"" with the ones I got along (Yes, it was a childish move, what else were you expecting of a 12 year old girl). Wrong desition. One of this kids, which I believe does not have reddit and has no way of knowing who I am, as I have changed a lot, won my trust and slowly built what I though a solid friendship that lasted a year, right before he did what I will refer to ""Take advantage of an emotionally fragile and suceptible 12 year old girl without friends or parental guiadance"". You all know what I am talking about.

The kid blackmailed me for some time, until we changed schools. He chose where I would go and told me, and due to fear, so did I. Fortunately for me, that kid didn´t transfer, and after the first day on this school, after a lot of anxiety and fear, I finally blocked him from my only social media, and didn´t saw him again. 

Since that event, and during highschool, a lot went on. What used to be a generally happy and joysful girl with anxiety problems turned into someone uncapable of trusting people, closed and always at the defensive. I adoped the ideal of believing only in human hypocresy and the fakeness of all around me, which up to this day, I still kind of hold dear. I skipped a lot of details, but I went from being forced to ""love"" my GM and show affection to that someone that made me feel like carp, as if nothing had happened, to being trapped under blackmail of someone I thought I could trust, some physical abuse, and non ending family problems. A lot of them. I simply couldn't trust anyone anymore.

As problems went by, I started to unhealthly blame what happened on me, up to the point I started hating myself. Day and night I would reming myself how much of an idiot I was, and slowly depersonalzied completely with my past self. I had a bitter personality, a pesimistic attitude, and a pissed off face all day, had trust issues, anxiety, and the constant feeling of being watched, judged, and that people were there just to try and hurt me. This thoughts become overwhelming, so I decided to shut my head by keeping me busy all day, started to have a ton of activities per day, tried to take off me all the free time I could, only good thing I got out of this was a diplomate on literature, at age 15. Some months later, though, I started to be too mentally exhausted to continue, but I had convinced myself that my only value came when I was being productive (which was what pushed me for some months under this tiring rountine). So, when I stopped doing things, it wasn´t a surprise I quickly lost all the self worth I had left. My self value came from being useful, but I wan´t being useful. It was a mess that has lasted this last five years, in which I have sunk deeply into my good friend, Mr. Depression. 

Originally I thought it was the teen years, the drama of the moment, nothing reelevant. Until one year ago, date of my first suicide attempt. Failed, if you couldn´t tell. Thoughts started to overwhelm me too much, I could wake up in the best of moods and be put off by a single miniscule thing, a single comment, or even, by nothing. I would start to break into tears without a reason, to get agitated out of nowhere, and feel terrible. As those ""look at me I am so deep"" images, it was like a cloud of black smoke that completely covered me whenever it wanted to, rendering me useless for weeks. I started to be unable to wake up somedays, stopped eating, drinking water. ""I couldnt meet any expectation, I am a dissappointment, I am letting everyone down, I am useless, I am stupid, I am a fake"". Whenever I tried to make anything or make myself useful, this thoughts would overhwelm me until I broke to tears, and had a constant impulse to bash my head against a wall to make them stop, and funnly enough, it was until recently I realized that bashing your head against a wall is a form of self harm.   

Nowdays, I just want to die. I no longer see it as some way of ""breathing"" and relieving any pain, as I am firm with this though werever Im sad or happy, in good or bad mood. ""I want to die"". For years all of this sites against suicide have conviced me that I want help, that I want to be better, to be happy. And I though I did, but honestly, there isn´t much here for me. People say I could have been a brilliant person, have a good job, get to a good degree of studies. Maybe I could, I could if I wasn´t me. I have one good friend which I will certainly miss when I am gone, but even if he refuses to accept it, we both know really well how easier would it be for him when I am gone. My family would trumble a bit, as their exange token will be gone (yes, they still do that), but it will eventually pass. The rest, they don´t even care. Strangers out there, they dont even care. They know its important to help distressed people, and maybe theyre guided by morality or what not, but they, perosnally, dont care. Why would I fight for a world that hasn´t done that for me, nor anyone? I am tired of that, I am tired of trying to get better, to be better, and to convince everyone im better. I know I have dissappointed all of them, fooled the ones I hadn´t with a fake intellectuality. Human hypocresy, as I mentioned. I am resented with life and with the nature of humanity, I hate a lot of people just by their mere existance, and specially, I hate me, with all my heart, with all my soul, I hate myself. I hate my choices, my life, all Ive done and what I have not. I would love to go back and mend my mistakes, but I cant, and no one can. And honestly, I don't want to live with them.

I used to say that there was a tiny spark of light inside myself, the memory of an old me, trying to survive, trying to tell me to be strong, to convince me that ""I am still here"", drowning in all this shit, in all the details skipped because this is too long and I am too busy to keep writing. I looked myself at the mirror today, and just realized, she is no longer here.

I don't want to try anymore, I don't have a reason to stay. I just want to die.

It was ""fine"" for 8 years, cause i told myself it would get better or i just kept going and kept going and kept going, but realizing today it just doesn't happen. I tried everything. I searched for a work and found it, i tried being a nice person to my family, i did sports regularly but every time i fix some broken shit i get slapped by my own decisions, past shit, people around me or something else.

My face looks like two different people. In good lighting I look good. When the light reveals the scars, it shocking. Horrifying. People say thing like ""your cheek is ruined."" and ""your skin is broken"".

"I need supportive friends, I can’t live with myselfI’m so lonely and too weak to make my mind stop the constant thoughts.. I don’t know where to even begin with this post, I’m ashamed to admit that my ex-girlfriend is what pushed me over the edge, I don’t want to be someone who’s suicidal over a break up, I want to be stronger than that, but I just am not..

I’m trying to keep this short and not put too much detail in but it’s a fairly long story either way..

This all happened about 3 weeks ago on a Friday evening, at this point I knew this girl for about 6 years, we dated on/off for about 5 years and have been consistently dating for nearly 2 years. We’ve been in a long-distance-relationship this whole time, this would’ve been fixed as soon as I’d go to uni in 1.5 years as I decided to get my uni degree in England to be closer to her. Basically I woke up to a text of her breaking up with me and I freaked out, called her repeatedly around 95 times before she picked up the phone, she explained her reasons why she wanted to break up but none of it made sense and it was all just reasons that could’ve easily been talked about and discussed normally, but eventually it got more heated and this lasted for around 2-4 days before I fucked up horribly, at first she wanted to stay friends and if only I took that option.. but no, the heated arguments made her decide she wanted to block me for a certain amount of time, but as soon as she said that I didn’t even read further than “blocking you”, I got so scared and told her I wouldn’t ever delete her nudes if she’d do that, she freaked the fuck out and yelled at me for 10 minutes straight and then became unresponsive for about 3 minutes, which scared me so much as she’s been dealing with depression ever since I met her and has been close to ending it before, I begged her not to do anything stupid and deleted everything, shortly after she blocked me from everything, but my phone was still logged into her Facebook, which I never logged out of until this day.. throughout the next two weeks I’d manage to get a 20 minute conversation here and there every few day things just didn’t get better, I confessed about my addiction for weed and that it’s been a big part as to why I’ve been distant for a long time, as she has a father who’s been dealing with drug addiction for her entire life and I didn’t want her to see me like him and leave me.. I haven’t touched anything since the day we broke up though and I told her this, to no success at making anything better, i made her a video that I put together since I’m a film student and it’s one of the few things in actually alright at, she liked it but it still didn’t make her want to be my friend.. now fast forward to a few days ago, a notification pops up on my phone from Facebook, and I couldn’t help myself but check it out, it was a conversation between her and a friend, saying how she’s got a date that night and that the guy is going to stay over at her place for a few days.. this completely crushed me as we both lost our virginity to each other and until a few days ago probably we were each other’s only experience.. I know this sounds a lot like lust, but I’ve turned down so many girls when I was a lot younger and lost it at quite a late age because I wanted to die only ever having known one girl and vice verse.. I basically couldn’t think straight anymore, carved her name into my arm and cut my entire forearm open, there’s probably anywhere between 40 to 60 cuts on my left arm currently.. afterwards I was dumb enough to take a picture of it and send it to her, telling her “I’m so sorry I’m too weak to handle this pain” and continued to take a bunch of pills right afterwards, thinking I wouldn’t wake up the next day.. I guess I had no idea how much it takes to end myself and this just made me feel so much worse when I woke up, but before I went to bed I sent her a few more texts, begging her to say her last goodbye (while she was on her date..), she still hasn’t opened any of the messages.. those were supposed to be my last hours alive and she was more bothered with going on a date 3 weeks after such a long relationship (for our age) than actually saying either goodbye or idk.. tell me she hated me? I just wanted her to say anything at all.. I really don’t know what to do anymore, I don’t actually want to kill myself over addiction, regret and a broken heart, but death is currently no longer a fear and what’s holding me back from taking more pills is knowing that my mom would probably kill herself too if her son committed suicide.. I have literally nobody in my life anymore, I had no friends because she was my best friend and all I wanted was to share time with her, I have nobody to talk to at all, I’m starting to fail college because I haven’t shown up in too long now, I’m either sleeping or constantly checking her messages and our old pictures.. I’ve lost so much weight in these three weeks, the last time I weigh this little was wen I was 16, when I just met her.. I really need friends who truly care for me as I’m currently incapable of doing so myself, people who will have my back in these times and she apparently can’t do that anymore but I don’t know where to find these people who are willing to spend their time helping me through this, I only know people who are down with you when you put on a fake smile and drink alcohol or smoke weed with them, I can’t have these kinds of people in my life anymore and I feel so isolated having nobody that cares.. I’m starting to be incapable of going outside any longer than 20 minutes as it just makes aggressive and I start to fear for my own safety, I feel like I’m starting to see random shadows in the corner of my eyes too whenever I’m outside and it gets too crowded although I don’t know if that’s actually the case or I just see people pass by.. I’m a very impulsive person and I’m probably going to do something horrible I’ll regret or puts me in danger again if I don’t get out of this place soon. I don’t want and can’t afford a therapist, don’t want to talk to any authority about this either in fear of getting put in a hospital, I really can’t afford to skip any more classes, if I fail this year I won’t be able to afford finishing college.. I don’t know what to do anymore..

(Please be kind and don’t say anything negative towards my ex, this is obviously not the entire story and she’s given me so many chances over the years to show change and prove that I’m a better person, but I was never able to until the day she left me.. the break up is entirely my own fault and I should’ve changed my sinful habits long ago, but that also doesn’t change the fact that we’ve been together for 5 or 2 years, however you look at it, and it’s only been 3 weeks and she has another guy sleeping over at her place currently.. I can’t keep my mind from thinking what’s going on and what’s happening right now, it’s driving me insane, but I have no distractions at all to keep my mind quiet, I can’t focus on college as my brain just decides to make me feel 10x worse that way, playing games and watching movies do the same thing.. all I’m capable of at the moment is listening to sad music, chain smoking cigarettes (which I didn’t even smoke before this) and checking our old pictures constantly..)

Also, although I’m mostly focusing on the break up, the addiction had its reasons, although I haven’t been suicidal before that break up, I never understood the point in life and why we do what we do and what purpose anything even has, the only motivation I had was knowing how horrible of a childhood my ex had and having a dream of providing her with an amazing and stable future by going to college and eventually university.. I’m a high school drop out so the fact I made it into college shows how much purpose this girl gave my life, but at the same time I still didn’t understand why we do a lot of the things in life that we do and it honestly feels like a rat race, running in circles forever with no true purpose or meaning, which is why I became addicted to weed, it got rid of those feelings, but I don’t ever want to touch that again, it’s a big part of why in this situation currently.. 

I’m sorry if this isn’t put together very well, I might’ve missed some parts and it’s probably a really long post, but I feel like I’ve said most of what I wanted to say.. 

Which leads me to why I’m here as my title already said.. I need a group of supportive friends badly, people who want to play games with me on a call so I don’t feel so alone and can make my mind shut up for a little while, people who might even want to watch movies with me, talk about music together and what else people do who are close friends to each other.. not only do I want a group of people who can support me emotionally and keep me company as often as possible, but eventually I want to be able to do the same back, having put all of my focus into this one person to the point I have literally nobody left the minute they left me has been such an unhealthy way of life that I really want to stop living as soon as I can. Eventually I hope to find someone to keep me company at night too, as those are the times I’m at my worst and I’m not in control anymore of when I sleep, I’m literally awake until I pass out and am incapable of having it any other way currently. Although I understand that I can’t find that here or anywhere, it’s something that has to come naturally and probably won’t something I’ll be able to achieve for a very long time.. especially with 60-ish cuts on my arm for the next month or so.

I understand if people don’t want to put this much effort into a stranger, I’d be surprised if there’s even more than 3 people who’d take the effort to read through this book of a post, but I hope someone can at least lead me in the right direction as to where I can find these types of people. I don’t really talk/type on online games as that’s a habit I’ve developed from years of smoking weed nearly daily and neither do I see myself creating any meaningful friendships this way..

And my most current ex girlfriend was so awesome and is going to college and she’s a league or three above me but she loved me so much and I helped her get her amazing job she has now that translates well to when she graduates and she’s fantastic but I broke up with her because in my head I just didn’t want a girlfriend anymore.... One of the absolute greatest humans ever and I just broke up with her. Almost literally just because.  And it has helped me to realize I thought I did it so I could grow and develop on things I’m working on. I have a very steady and lucrative job for someone in their low 20s and I’m doing very okay financially. I stream. I have a small podcast. I do comedy for a verrryyy small group. (10-15) I’m literally doing great. But for the first time in my life I want to kill myself. I haven’t even thought about how but that’s what I want. I can’t stand what my mind thinks anymore. Im not pleased with how I look but that’s natural. But I’m scared and confused?! I know depression comes in so many forms but I don’t understand??? My biggest fear is that I will be forgotten. And it sickens me. I can literally think about how I feel I’m not making enough of an impact on this earth and worry and bother myself until I’m throwing up and bawling. I don’t know what I need but I’d love some insight. Thank you so much if you’ve read this and I’m scared to see what you’ll have to say..",suicidal,high

"In a crisis centerI finally told my bf that I havent been doing well, and mentioned i had a timeline that I'm trying not to act on. So he called the police, who said I either would be in the hospital for 3 days, or I could go to a crisis center. I cant miss work, so i went to the center. I'm supposed to be up in an hour or so and have only gotten 4 hrs of sleep. This hasnt helped me. I just feel worse cause now my loved ones know how ive been feeling. I could barely look at him as I was telling my bf cause he has told me a lot recently that he doesnt like how much i cry, and i dont mean to, but I do, so i was trying not to as i told him, and then he says its not the crying. He told me he just had to go to the bathroom, but then the cops came. I just wanted to hug him for a bit and see him, but instead ive got 4 hrs of sleep to function on for work later. I'm sorry this isnt super coherant, I'm really tired. I gave him the thing i was thinking of using and he still called the cops. Now all I want to do is find another way to do it cause i feel like I was just shuffled off to a place so i wouldnt cause them worry.

"Documenting my journey to VTDNot sure if this is the proper forum. For this information, but would greatly appreciate a point in the right direction in which this information can be legacised.

Hi Reddit. Long time lurker, never had much to add. I am however about to embark on a journey and I would like to share with others my experiences. I'm not looking for judgement, persuasion, or otherwise. My descision is completely final, and I thought it might help others to read my story. I don't want to give out too many of my details as I don't think it is necessary, and could potentially bring shame on my family. After a lot of research on the various methods of suicide, I have settled on voluntary terminal dehydration. I'd like to start that, I am very much so one of the weak ones, that could be  considered as irrational suicide. However by the time this is complete, I feel irrational can be ruled out as this is the best course of action in my life.

I can start out by saying, I've had a cousin commit suicide by shotgun when I was 11 years old. It devastated my family. He was an AAA student, an extremely talented classical musician, had college offers to very prestigious schools, and for lack of any information committed suicide  out of impulse one day. I do not believe it was impulse. I believe he had valid reasons. No one will know these reasons, but I am the one person that never really mourned for him, I saw it as his escape. He felt that was the best course of action in his life, I trust him. I was never mad at him, only sad for what I never for to learn from him. I don't think any other person has this view of the event, and I always understand him. From the very second I heard he was missing, to the years of angst and turmoil it then exuded on his mother, I could never agree with those so angry with him, and calling him a coward when putting a shotgun to your face and pulling the trigger can only be one of the hardest things a person can think about, and actually follow through with. I never felt it affected me that much, but as I grow older, I can see in one way it affected my believe s on our right to die. Perhaps, he had very dark seeded issues that were only going to manifest in the actual physical hurt of others. In that case does it not perhaps make him a hero for actually saving potential lives? No one will know, but in reality it doesn't matter, it was his choice to make.

To my story, I am one of the weak ones. Gifted with certain abilities to learn very fast, build and repair things with my hands, and solid judgement and reasoning skills have no terminal illness, am in relatively In good heath with no major issues other than some chronic back pain(don't we all tho)?. Which all in itself can be construed as irrational suicide. I hope to prove that in following through with my methods, it can become clear for all this was no snap judgement, and is the best thing for my own mental happiness, which I have found out is forever going to be unattainable for me.

The relationship with my( going through divorce) wife, is something that would take many years of words and many pictures to describe. We have been in each other's near 24/7 presence for 17 years. I am 33. We met when I was 17, we were both in into a party life and started doing heavy drugs together. From that moment 17 years ago, we have literally spent every minute together. This involves multiple jobs we have pulled of successfully together( all jobs but the last year) and I say all jobs I meant them all, however we were never the ones to hop around, each job lasting years, until out most important one, we ran an automotive shop together for 11 years. Everything we have always done was all or nothing, and we have always been hard workers and loyal to a fault. Through the time at that shop however, we started to drift apart due to anxiety, and anger on my end. After working so long for someone, making them so comfortable and making so much money, I began to resent my position and felt like I deserved a bit more of a promise in our future. This created many issues in our relationship, and was the beginning of the end of our 24/7 lifestyle. She was offered a position given by my mother in which offered me to quitthe shop and be a stay at home dad. I did all my duties as SAHD. Was performing homeschool for our son ( another story in itself, we were told we could not have children, and it took us 10 years to bring our beautiful son into this world) the housework among other things. I wasn't happy. I got jealous of the time lost with her. Always wanted to be with her and it was hard making the change. All I needed was to be happy.  She now believes she is happy now, and that I cannot, and it has created a major rift in the way she percieves my response, and my feelings behind them. i have made a lot of changes in my personality to suit her, but it is too little too late. She will forever see me for the old me, no matter how hard I try. 

There is a bout 2 decades to the realtionshiop that would take millions of words to explain, explaining how I may not believe in God, but I believe in soulmates. I believes she is mine, and that I am not hers. I do not get another chance at that due to my beliefs.


So for those interested, I would like to document my journey to the end via my choice of method. I own firearms, but would like my son to see in casket. I also believe such a violent death will be harder on him than maybe I can make it be. I understand the statistics on child parent suicide, and still can not accept and move on and are three times as likely to do it themselves. I can not see past my pain and am too weak to accept this as a reason to move on. He will have a great mother and support system, and while we all go through traumas I truly believe he will move on with not much less than the hate for me I will deserve. I've tried my best in my notes to explain the absolute lack of fault on his end and how, all I can teach him is bad habits to be like me. 

So here I will post my diary, day one.  Weeks of research and contemplation has gone into this and this method won't have ant interesting affects for the next few days.

Day one, this is happening. My wife was on literal suicide watch last night because at that point I was determined to be at peace ASAP. After deliberation and deciding on my course. She would not let me out of her sight and I cannot allow police to be involved, they only have the power to prolong this process and I am ready. She truley cares about me as a friend, and knows my son doesn't deserve this. She is right. But I don't either. My last meal is an incredibly healthy  taco Bell dinner my wife brought home for me.. she was always trying to take care of me, whether I deserved it or not. As of now, Taking a few things to ease the anxiety. And will prbobly comment here on a daily basis chronologically recording how it feels and my thoughts along the way. I've heard it is relatively painless method with medical treatment, but I will be doing this alone, so far with no real support system but myself.",suicidal,high
"MeditationI have been carefully meditating and I've finally come to to the conclusion that I want to die. Truly, not sure if it's a broke switch in my brain or not, but I'm trying to decide how.

Personally, I would rather be given a large injection of ""Belladonna"" the pretty lady. Opium mixed with nightshade I believe, should be a helluva trip before my heart stops.

Or perhaps something violent, bloody, gory. All I know is I keep taking the doctors pills and they are robbing me of what little life I feel I have.

Gas bag with helium sounds good too since faking a license to get a firearm seems like a hassle.

Honestly I just want to get away from everyone for a bit, take enough opium so that the hunger doesn't hurt too much, and then od and fade away.

"I'm starting to feel suicidal again this year and I really need therapyThis pandemic and school semester have really pushed me into an unstable mental state and I'm constantly scared I'm close to falling apart and collapsing entirely. I'm an architecture major so my constant studio presentation deadlines have me working for 14 hours every day with really minimal time to take breaks or take care of myself properly. This extends into all my weekends and holidays. It's become so hard to stop myself from breaking down and it's become even harder to find time to spend with family or friends. My boyfriend has been going through a lot of issues with the pandemic and school as well and I can slowly feel myself become more and more unable to support him properly since I'm struggling so much myself. Its breaking my heart to see my personal love life (and family life too) strain under the tension of my struggles. I used to be pretty suicidal in high school and I'm feeling those thoughts creep back into me the more this hard year goes on.  

I'm scared because I can't do anything to immediately help either my boyfriend or myself. I'm terrified something's going to snap and I'm going to lose him or myself. I want to be happy so badly but it's becoming more and more grim each day and I dont know how many more 14 hour work days I can handle before my body shuts down. 

I desperately need therapy. I need professional guidance on how to cope with my stress and how to properly support my boyfriend in a way that doesn't hurt my own emotional state. I've always been scared of therapy because my parents raised me in a very strict mentality of thinking its taboo (immigrant parenting be like that), but I really want to just be consistent with getting professional help for once and recover properly (I tried a few times before but I always stopped going after a month or so because I always thought I I wasnt ""stressed enough"" for it later on). After my final architecture studio presentation next Thursday, I'm going to call my university counseling center and ask for help. I need to. This post is more of a reminder to myself that I really need to do this. My body can't handle anymore stress without proper professional help.

"Considering it.Hi all, this is my first post.
I've been having suicidal thoughts for some time now, something that started like 2 years ago. 
I'm about to turn 30, and was diagnosed with GAD (generalized anxiety disorder).
Lot's of things have happened in the last  eight months as i graduated from med school,, i finished a five year relationship and tried to start another, and my father had a stroke that left him with sequels (i currently live with both of my parents).
This isn't easy for me to write, as i feel not only as am a failure but that i'm ashamed of myself. I don't think i'm worthy of anything of value, and all effort is futile.

As my long term relationship was getting worse, i got to meet a girl and started to hang out with her around the same time my father had the stroke. Never did i cheat before, as i was very loyal and had ethic above everything, but something really happened and  i did. I felt awful after, but couldn't stop seeing her. Few months passed and we got to a point to decide what we should do. I called it off, as did'nt wanted to hurt anybody. two months later after finishing the long term relationship i called her and we met, only to go out and have this weird date... Long story short she's seeing somebody and mentioned that ""might be the biggest mistake of her life but i have to chose him"" and the relationship between us can't be ""for now"" . After not seeing each other since then anymore we're contacting by mail at the moment. i miss her. ok so there's that.

My father is not getting better, and also has depression so even though i'm trying to help him recover nothing seems to work. Most probably he won't never be the same.
I do have friends, but i feel like they don't get me. Im exercising almost everyday. I also go to a psych and im on pregabalin for gad. I play guitar and i'm trying to record what i can. I feel like im doing my best and it's not enough.

Honestly i don't know where to go o what to do. I feel that i only have myself and that it is not enough.
I'm thinking on stuff to do, like a bucket list before i go. i don't know anymore.",suicidal,high

"Unemployed 23M, I can't stop fantasizing about an attempt.I have been battling serious depression for 3 years. I have been getting help for over 1. On fluoxetine as well as cannabis. I self harm, currently 2 months clean.

I'm sitting in my apartment that my parents pay for with my long time friend getting stoned and watching tv. All I can think about is cutting myself, or killing myself. I even saw my counsellor today, that my parents pay for, sigh I will never be abke to function. 

I frequently fantasize about attempting, I don't want to die. I just desperately want more immediate help. I just want to stop suffering. In Ontario, Canada our mental health support is terrible.

I've failed and had to drop out of University, all at once I lost free counselling, prescription coverage and my transit pass.

I'm currently trying to fill out job applications and get my resume out. How am I supposed to work?

I've been hospitalized before and it was fucking horrible. 8 hour wait time in emergency, then a 72 hour hold. I'll go into cannabis withdrawals and they'll shove me full of fucking benzos.

My counsellor wants me to toss the blades and eat, obviously, but neither have happened yet.

"The idea of suicide seems comforting to meReading through some posts here, I understand logically that my life is supposed to be okay. I'm 18, recently started working as a full time developer in a start up. Finished school with great grades and supposed to go to Uni next year.

However, I think of commiting suicide almost daily. I feel like anyone who has been my friend is now derogatory towards me. I feel like if I don't act like shit towards who I thought were my friends I won't get any respect. Same goes with my mother who's a depressed woman that takes it all out on me.

To be honest, nothing really feels fun to me anymore. Not trying to date girls, not playing my intruments. The only thing I think about that makes me feel some comfort, that makes me a little bit happy is the thought of just ending it all and writing a letter to everyone.",suicidal,high

"Really need someone to talk to...I've had social anxiety ever since I decided to go to a different school than all the people I grew up with during the transition from elementary school to high school. During the early years in my life up to grade 8 I wasn't socially anxious at all, in fact I was always the one to make people laugh and put on a show, didn't mind the spotlight. The only problem was these people I never really felt like I fit in with the people I grew up with. I'd get invited out occasionally but I never really fit it so I decided to start over by going to a different high school. 

This would be the worst decision of my life. During my two years there I was paralyzed with anxiety, made one friend and began to get depressed. While everyone was out enjoying life and hanging out with friends I was glued to the computer, getting lost in video games as an escape from reality. I would play every second I had and I feel that's what lead me to develop an anxiety disorder. Oddly enough I still had no problem going to and from class, or walking alone in public or anything of that nature. That was 10 years ago.

I'm 25 now and have been through a lot since then. After being diagnosed back in 2007 I was on various drugs, most of them didn't work except for one, cipralex. For one whole year, cipralex had effectively convinced me that my socially anxious days were over. I could finally be that person I'd always wanted to, I always knew that I had that person in me but the anxiety was preventing me from being that person. After a year of feeling on top of the world the medication started to lose it's effect and I slowly spiraled downward.

I was pretty bummed at this point. I started reading up on social anxiety on the internet, I wanted to know how it worked, once I knew that I could surely put an end to it over time. This is when I learned about cognitive behavioral therapy. I originally got a book by David D Burns to overcome my anxiety but quit half way through. I ended up living with the fact that I was anxious for a few years but back in December of 2011 I came across an audio series on overcoming social anxiety. 

The series required you to listed to a tape each week and read over the handouts for that session every day. And I was faithful, I'd read way past the recommended 30 minutes a day often. To be perfectly honest I now know more about SA than I have in my life, and I'm currently still on the program, a little over half way through and being faithful. I've put many of the strategies and methods learned into every day life and have had some success. I've been able to calm myself down at times and focus more externally by rationalizing my irrational thinking and taking them into a situation that would normally make me anxious.

At this point you're probably thinking that I posted this in the wrong section, and that it sounds like things are looking up. Well they are and they aren't. Getting over an anxiety disorder will cause relapses, so I could have my anxiety under control for a few days and then a few days after feel like a wreck. I'm supposed to be looking at relapses as a positive thing because you can't have a relapse if you haven't made progress. And I admit I have.

Here's the issue. Although I have this whole whack of knowledge now and have seen in work first hand, this requires a lot of work mentally. See before I knew any of this I'd just let the negative thinking flow freely, but now anytime that occurs there are steps and things I need to do to escape for the vicious circle of anxiety. On top of that, there are things I'm having trouble with now. Getting out of the house can be a nightmare at times, driving is nerve wracking at times.. Anytime I'm stopped next to someone at a red light I tense up and freeze because I feel they are looking at me. Even though I know that feelings can be false because they are created by thoughts and my thoughts are irrational. Getting a job is another obstacle I've yet to overcome. I graduated from college 4 months ago and have been unemployed since - and to be honest as of late I've been pretty much cooped up in my house - with the occasional outing on weekends to a bar or lounge. 

Every day when I wake up I know I have to prepare myself for another mental struggle with myself and it's tiring. My friends don't usually contact me unless I initiate first. And recently a friend who I've known since I was 4 has been really distant for some reason. Bottom line is is it worth it? I'm 25, no job, can't even go to the store without having a battle with my own mind... I just don't know what to do. My family knows I have Anxiety but not specially Social Anxiety. They don't understand that these simple things like going to the store or applying for a job are very challenging for me. They chalk it up to me being lazy and unmotivated when in actuality if I had rid myself of this I would have be the polar opposite. I want a future, I don't want to be a deadbeat.. But at the same time there's only so long I can continue to get rid of my SA before I become tired. I'm starting to learn toward the ""it's not worth it side"". Can anyone give me some advice? any advice? 

If you read my entire post I really appreciate it.

TLDR: Had a rough time in highschool no friends, eventually diagnosed with social anxiety many years later, tried medication that worked but eventually stopped. Been doing cognitive therapy for the past 4 months, seems to be working, but recently questioning whether or not it's even worth it anymore.",suicidal,high

"I feel brokenOne of my longtime friends passed some time ago and I thought I had been handling the loss ok.  Unrelated to that loss, I've been struggling with thoughts of suicide and my self-worth is low.  But I had a dream last night about hugging her one last time before she passed that made me feel so happy and calm until I woke up and realized it wasn't real and I'd never get to say goodbye.  Her kids have to grow up without their parents, because the dad killed her and then himself.  It hurts so much and I just want it all to stop, but I don't want to hurt my friends.  I want to either stop hurting, or be able to wake up and not start shaking because the thought of seeing people makes me so anxious I'm sick.  I just want to feel better at any cost",suicidal,high

"I'm sick of online classesI am tired of not doing anything all day, sitting in front of a computer screen too out of my mind to even do my homework. I'm tired of doing nothing during online classes, just staring into the camera like a f###ing donkey. I have not done most of my homework for two months now, and i feel like my head is about to explode. When i AM doing my homework, i can't focus on anything and when my dad tries to help me i'm not even paying attention to what he's saying and we spend a shit ton of time nearly every month/week trying to make me understand my homework while i am not even focusing on what's being told. If i don't pass the 8th grade i'm sure as f##k that i'm gonna kill myself or will end up hospitalized. I don't want to disappoint my family if i don't pass. ADHD is a curse. You guys can't help me, i'm completely f###ed up. I don't know what to do anymore but it doesn't matter. Soon i will get rid of myself and will get the sweet embrace of death. I feel like sh#t doing this because i have so many friends and family that would feel like crap if i killed myself and it hurts like hell to think what they could go through after i die. I don't even know where i will go after i die. Probably i will go to hell anyways. But i'm ready. Whatever i have to face now, i really deserve it.

"My mom hates me. I can't take it anymore. Ever single day she tells me. She hates me. Nothing I do will be good enough and everything I do is wrong. I'm a complete fuck up. I wear the wrong clothes and get yelled at. I don't wear enough makeup or do my hair the way she likes. That means that I'll get a lecture about how everyone else hates me and they're all going to laugh at me because I look stupid and I'm fat and I'm never going to get a job. 

I can not live like this anymore. I hate her, too. She's a stupid bitch who's fucking obsessed with what other people think. I hate makeup, and I hate straightening my hair, and I hate the clothes she demands I wear(or else I won't get a ride to somewhere I need to go). I hate her declaring that I owe her money the second I get any at all. Fuck her. I'm tired of being criticized every fucking minute.

Maybe I deserve it. I'm 20 years old, I haven't accomplished anything. I don't have a paying job(fucking intern), I don't have any degree. I'm going to be stuck living with this jerk forever and it isn't worth it. 

Everything is fucked up. I hate myself. She's made me hate myself. She laughs at everything I try to do, as condescending as possible. Oh, I'm trying to make it in graphic design? She'll laugh and ask how it's possible that anyone will pay me for my stupid childish hobby. 

It gets worse every day and I want to die. I can't move out. i don't have ANYTHING. No good experience, nothing. Who the fuck would hire me, anyways? I look like a stupid fucking hobo and everyone will probably laugh at me and think I'm disgusting.

My sister laughs at me, too. She often agrees with my mom. That whenever I get upset over this stuff I'm being dramatic, sensitive, and paranoid. And she calls me selfish every time I ever need anything. I don't know how I'm supposed to do everything they want! I have to just obey what my mom wants me to look and act like, and stfu whenever I might need anything because I'll get in trouble if I dare voice anything. if I ever try to bring up something I'm thinking about I'll get yelled at. I should just never talk. I should just die. 

I'm doing everything wrong. Maybe if I was the kind of daughter my mom wanted then I'd be ok. Maybe she'd even help me with the other shit that I'm going through. That's the worst thing. That the only help I really need from her she'll never give me. I don't know what I want anymore. 

I can't stay here, and I can't get away. Suicide looks like the best option, but I'm scared. I don't know if I have a choice. I can't stay here. ",suicidal,high

Life is just not fun; every day seems to be worse than the last. 21 years and I don't remember a time I was truly happy. The only thing that keeps me going is something another suicidal friend told me: ""Might as well stick around and see if anything cool happens."" I'm always waiting and looking. Nothing ever does though. I have tried all these crazy things to make my life meaningful: traveling, having multiple sex partners, great relationships, reading/education, being a social butterfly, internships/jobs, etc.

"not my fucking month apparently!i've never really had it ""easy"" but these past few weeks have just been rougher than usual.

it started out with a sharp increase in my depression due to the seasonal changes, making everything seem a lot worse than it is while increasing my suicidal thoughts

next thing is at work with my managers acting a lot harsher than normal, being so nitpicky about the smallest of things even if it isn't my fault. I work in a pet store so an example would be getting lectured about how the hamsters don't have food in their bowls when in reality they just moved it into their hide bc that's what hamsters do. when i explain that (and show them) they say i should just move the food to the bowls but they apparently don't listen when i tell them that i do that but the moment i put it in the bowl, the hamsters rush to hoard it. i understand that they are under pressure from their bosses and our corporate offices are shit with shit policies that make little sense but it doesn't make it any easier for me for my other coworkers. what makes it rougher for me is that i've been at this place for over two years now, i'm easily the best worker in my department (i say because i've been told by previous managers and i have the most responsibility+hardest jobs in my department) yet i rarely ever get compliments or just good feedback in general, especially this past year. i just want some positive feedback p l e a s e

The next thing that happened was my support group being cancelled for the next two weeks. i ended up getting a call half an hour before i would have left to get there. i didn't really mind it all thaaat much but it still bummed me out because i had to miss the last one due to a dr appointment

then, speaking of my dr appointment, it was my dr being convinced i can be transferred to an out of state clinic (i pretty much live on the border of two states) despite the fact that i'm on state insurance and know for a fact that they wont take my insurance so i have to wait even longer for a much needed surgery consultation which, in itself, has already taken months to get to and will take even longer before i have a surgery date despite the urgency

And then? i rode my bike half an hour to get to my early morning therapy session after not having an appointment for nearly two weeks (not my choice, my therapist had a training thing for one week so i had to skip that weeks appointment and i didnt even think about asking to see someone else at the time) i got there, waited 10 minutes in the waiting room only for the receptionist to tell me she forgot to call and say my therapist wasn't in for the next two weeks. it fucking sucks because i really needed to talk about some things that have really been bothering me including my recent uptick in suicidal ideations and manic episodes

and today? the concert tour i got a ticket for (aka the ONE thing i've been looking forward to for months now and the ONE thing i let myself not feel guilty over buying) might have to cancel the stop closest to me! apparently the venue shut down bc of safety concerns so they're trying to find a new venue but the only reason i could even get the tickets was because it was in such a convenient location- there would be buses running all night and it would only take a little under an hour to get there (for context, i cant drive mainly due to disability and buses into the city usually take 2+hrs from where i am and it's hard to find ones that run late at night to where i need to go)

and somewhere in there i got my hopes up about an audition for a haunted house i thought i would be able to go to but i didn't see that the house would be at a different location from the audition. in retrospect, i should have known better but idk what i was thinking in the moment. the audition location was accessible and i got so excited about it, even giong so far as to prepping my monologue and character, but then i found out the location of the actual houses was just... not possible for me. it would take over an hour to bike (which i know i cant do bc some was uphill and i know myself enough to know i couldnt do that) and there apparently arent any buses to that location or even close to it. a few days later i found out someone in my support group got hired/cast for it which was a fucking low blow to my self esteem

all of this has just been adding up and adding up and tbh! i cant fucking stand it! the only reason i don't currently have a plan is bc i know my dog needs me. she's been misunderstood and tossed around all her life and has only gotten a good life when i got her, over two years ago now. i know i have to be strong for her but its so fucking hard sometimes",suicidal,high

I am currently seeking treatment for mental health. My mental health often interferes with my work. I have a family history of mental health issues. I would seek help for mental health issues. There might be negative consequences for discussing mental health issues. Additional thoughts: I answered based on previous job at large technical company where I was pushed out of my role within 3 months of disclosing diagnosis.I had been struggling for 3 months prior to disclosure and was incredibly relieved when finally diagnosed. Growing up in a family open about mental health and also at the end of my rope I immediately shared with management what was going on. I requested a temporary reduced workload so I could reduce anxiety. (At time I didn't know it was anxiety as took me a year to accept that the (to me) deserved stress was anxiety caused by my core diagnosis.) When disclosing I didn't deeply understand details of the state of my mental health; I simply knew I was so stressed out by having been unable to get myself to do work in three months that I couldn't juggle all that was currently on my plate.It was at this point my direct manager and I began an almost daily struggle. After working on a single project and making progress (compared to 3 months before diagnosis when management didn't even know how bad I was doing) I requested increasing my workload. This was never granted; boss said I hadn't proved myself and implied I could not be trusted.Two huge issues stick out to me from that experience:1) Company assumes things would be better and back to 100% within months. They did not understand what one goes through when figuring out meds: things at times got worse. They did not understand how long it takes until meds are figured out: mine took two years. They most certainly would not truly understand why to this day four years later despite being stable I'm in counseling every other week in addition to being on meds. Rather than supporting that it would be seen as oh I'm sorry. I was a problem to my manager because he didn't see improvements each week.2) Accomodations.- There was no option for me to reduce work temporarily to part-time (too complicated). Instead they pushed me to take disability leave. I told them that wouldn't help; they told me to double-check with care providers. That required me to see a psychologist unnecessarily as psychologist said I didn't qualify for leave. (Expensive unnecessary appointment).- The assistance I needed the most at work was understanding: I was open but my manager told me to not tell my co-worker assigned to support me. That was disasterous for colleague's stress/frustration levels. He knew something was up but was barred from asking and I was implied it was better to keep my mouth shut.- Accommodations weren't understood by even Benefits as they're not trained in mental health nor do they have people come in to assess how they're doing in supporting those with mental health issues. Should be no different than people coming in to assess for physical accessibility of the workplace. When in a meeting with my manager supervised by HR I shouldn't feel like I'm asking too much of manager when requesting he put the negative critiques on the back burner and help me figure out whether I'm doing anything right. That this didn't stop him from coming into my office that same day and putting on my dick hat to yell at me for something that wasn't even my fault (he had brought in co-worker for this yelling and turned to finish yelling at this person): FUCKING UNACCEPTABLE.While I will never return to that company and as such took the severance package I will NEVER agree with their legal reason for being unable to do the job: me being medically disqualified from this role. I was too expensive in the short term for them; I'm not worth the cost.,depression,medium

"I’m Just Frustrated and at My Wits End. I hated how in elementary school, middle school, and my early years of high school I was pushed by my mother to work hard and be the best in school. 

Now here I am, my last year of high school burnt out and confused. I was A honor roll, apart of GT, and I’ve been invited to various clubs because of my academic achievements but for what?? Just for me to reach the end and be burnt out? Unless you’re going to some Ivy League school or prestige college or university, they could care less about middle school and your first two years of high school; they damn sure don’t care at all about elementary school. 

I have no motivation, I don’t really know what I want to do, I just want to move away from my family and home. I originally let my mother talk me into sticking around after I graduate, but now I’ve decided I want to leave. 

Only problem is, I only applied to one school because I knew that’s where I was going because it was close to home, literally like twenty minutes up the road. Now I want to leave but I’ve barely applied anywhere, there’s probably not a lot of financial aid left to go around for the school I do decide to go to last minute. 

My mental health is absolute dog shit. No one even knows I feel this way for me to be taken anywhere to be evaluated and get help. 

I lie to everyone and my doctor every year at my check up and say I’m doing great, which I kinda like but then again I hate it. Therefore, I have no sort of diagnosis for anything so I’m just constantly thinking I’m over exaggerating and I’m just invalidating the way I feel, even though I know this isn’t a normal nor healthy way to think.

"i failed again. and now im in deep shit.last week tuesday i took around 50 antidepressants out of the 80 i had been secretly stockpiling (my mom doesn't let me access my own medication because i have a past of overdosing, but i knew where she hid it anyway) over the past few months. this was an intended suicide, and a few hours prior to taking these i had taken my usual cocktail of meds i use for sleep thinking i could just drift to sleep and never wake up.

frustratingly i laid in bed for hours and waited for either death or sleep to come, but there was nothing. given the amount i had taken i assumed i would either go unconcious fairly quickly or be incapacitated by a seizure. so i decided to take another 10 and hope for the best. unfortunately this ended up causing me to throw up — which was awful because the medication burned the back of my throat and tasted so bad — so i don't know how much i ended up actually absorbing.

that night i took the rest of my stockpiled antidepressants, which was only about 15-20, with my sleep medication and about 10 claritin gel capsules just for funsies. i didn't throw up this time and expected to experience a somewhat life threatening reaction. again, nothing happened and i barely slept.

finally, early on wednesday morning, i was so fed up and determined to die i went to where my mom hides my all of my medication (sleeping pills, antidepressants, anti-anxiety meds) and took every last pill. it was 6 10mg belsomra, 26 60mg antidepressants, and 20 15mg hydroxyzine pamoate pills. i also took 12 benadryl and 10 more claritin gel capsules on top of that. i wanted to die so bad i was willing to risk it all. but as you can see, i am unfortunately STILL LIVING, and risk it all i sure did.

i don't fucking know how im alive. especially given the fact that i had consumed over 100 pills in less than 48 hours. my liver heart and kidneys have to be made of titanium because there's no fucking way any normal human being would survive that. and before anyone asks, i didn't throw up any of that medicine. i didn't even feel anything until about 6 hours later and it was only mild drowsiness and some tremors.

my mom found out i had taken all of my pills rather quickly after she came home from work. maybe 15 minutes max. must be that motherly instinct. i told her it was far too late to get my stomach pumped and that i honestly felt ok. she didn't believe me at all (i was telling the truth) but as i'm 19 she can no longer force me to go to the hospital without calling the police. i may have been more open to it but past traumatic experiences from my stays in the psychward as a minor have kept me from hospitals and therapy in general for 4 years.

so i'm out of stock, my mom has my meds sealed in a safe now, and i'm never going to die the nice painless, peaceful death i wanted so desperately unless i go out and buy a gun to blow my brains out with :) yay me!",suicidal,high

"Tired of suffering just to make parents happy20 years old and been depressed since I was 10/11. Suicidal ideation throughout. Never wanted to die, just tired of going through the slight ups and major downs of life. Been living the past 6+ months just to make my parents happy that I’m not dead. Almost tried it once with pills, but know the odds aren’t good. Was looking into fentanyl instead. Might just say I’m running away and drive as far as I can and see if I can overdose. Love my parents and friends but just tired of me suffering. Keep trying to get a plan in my life, but can’t figure it out and parents don’t know what to do either, but can’t blame them because I’ve done this to myself. Not ready for the pressure ahead either, college, life, more relationships (last one wasn’t too great).

I would not seek help for mental health issues. I feel there would be negative consequences for discussing mental health issues. Additional thoughts: Too many people even especially IT considered mental health issues as a choice or something people can freely act about. You are depressed: take vacation. You feel weird: admit it is physical (otherwise it is not serious) go and see a doctor (and if you are on sick leave too many days you will get fired). You don't feel good today: take a holiday but don't work from home. In startup there is what I call the tyranny of happiness: you have to look happy to be accepted and to be worked with. At some point playing a role can definitely make the mental health issue worse and it is also a threat to diversity :(I don't like to call mental health issues an issue but actually when it comes to company field it too often becomes an issue and this is sad because working is sometimes better than medication. It is a vicious circle: people are scared of speaking about it so they don't inform their coworkers about what mental health is for real and so coworkers are so scared on a regular basis that the people with mental health issues keep it for themselves. ,depression,medium

"Well I’m lonely now. 😔 Hey guys, I know this pandemic has bard a bit hard on us all, but one thing I’d like to point out is how we aren’t really physically socializing with our friends. Thank the lord for technology, and other stuff that helps us communicate, and have fun. Recently I started to build a 1000 dollar gaming pc of my own, because a couple of my friends had been doing this recently, and have been playing on them. I’m 14, overweight, and not too good looking tbh. I asked my friends what games I should play with them after I’m done. I know we started school again, and are way more busy, but they said they don’t really play anymore. There have also been way too many times on the weekend were they said they could play, but then alter they just say eh I don’t really want to. I’m a little lonely right now ngl. I just wanted to share that loneliness is real, and it can be something to consider serious. My parents tell me to do a bunch of chores when I’m bored, and sometimes I’m so bored I might actually do them.

"I have nobody left.No friends left, disowned by my parents, girlfriend ""wasnt ready for a relationship"" after everyone told her she was stupid for getting with a sick boyfriend. Guess its kind of a good thing anyways. One of the biggest things keeping me from doing it was not wanting to hurt people, but now with nobody left to hurt, nobody to turn to for help, i feel like i could do it without any guilt. Idk if i should even explain my reasons for it, but ive had suicidal thoughts since i was a kid, maybe just bored with life and always feeling so hollow, even when shit goes south i cant cry even when i want to. Every day is painful to breathe, and to be honest i dont want to get better. I already hated the fact that of all people to survive a bout with cancer, it had to be a suicidal fuck up like me. 
So all things considered, suicide might just be the biggest accomplishment of my life.

"If a person you once knew commited suicide, and if you knew that he did and knew the reasons for it, you would definitely blame yourself for letting that happen, would you want to know anyway?Well, how do I begin...

I should say that to an outsider, I might not seem all that depressed or suicidal, and that unlike most people here, I don't really have a reason to try and commit suicide. On the outside I might seem incredibly lucky and not caring, a funny guy with some popular opinions, some unpopular opinions, no health problems, or any other problems, with a cool circle of friends, etc

I was born in Russia, and lived there for 18 years out of my current almost 20, and I consider my nationality to be Russian (although not exactly). Right now I moved to university in France, something very few people can afford. Here I might not exactly have a lot of problems, but I feel incredibly lonely, I feel like not fulfilling what I should and I feel not interesting to the French people to talk to, I also find my appearance to be repulsing, etc. I really want to feel needed by somebody, to not feel like people want to abuse me into doing something, but feel that I really make someone happy, feel like someone truly needs me for what I am, not what they can make me do.

Almost 4 years ago I met a girl, and we were talking for the whole New Year's Eve. She turned out to be not romantically interested, but decided to remain friends after I opened up to her, and I... Oh well, interested I was. Very was. And still am. She was (and still is) just... Perfect. Perfect appearance, perfect voice, perfect personality. And... Well, after that she moved to the other side of the world, and then I moved even farther from her, and so right now even if anyone was interested doing something would be incredibly, like, incredibly hard. For the past 4 years we were talking to each other on and off, but I never quite forgot her.

Right now I feel like I don't want to live without her, ever. That even if I somehow managed to, I would never be truly happy. Would never feel truly safe from being turned down at any moment. I have almost decided now that the best thing for me would be to end this cringe comedy. And... I don't know. Do I want that? Is it really true? Is this happening to me?

I don't know whether I want help with these thoughts for myself or just to know whether I should tell her what's happenning. She once knew I was suicidal, I was (unknowingly and pathetically) trying to manipulate her. I don't know whether me just saying that I want to be left alone would help her forget me, whether she will remember that I was suicidal, try to contact me and fail, and never have closure of what happenned to me, whether she will simply forget, or whether, before going out, I should write to her and explain what I want to do, apologise for doing that and say that I love her and will never forget her and, if the afterlife is true, I will always stay by her side? Will she blame herself for letting me do that for her entire life, even though nothing she could do would prevent that? I don't want to do THAT to her - in fact, I only want her to be happy...

I remember very clearly this one time i asked her if she was playing with the 'popular girls' and spreading lies about me so that she would become popular? she straight up answered with yes. and because i have a hard time hating people (and being oblivious) she would convince me my bully wasn't bullying me. and that she was just a little mean. and that i was just jealous of the other girls not hurt by them not wanting to play with me. luckily my teachers noticed that i didn't play with anyone but her. they tried to kind of separate us, so that i would get social with the other kids. and that slowly made me realize what she was doing. i tried to 'break up' with her but she just began spreading rumers. then i tried again she began crying hysterically, so i said i was just joking. sometime after that a girl that had started in our school a year before became our friend. slowly me and the girl became bestfreinds but my other bestfreind didn't like that.( i'll call my exbest freind Britney from now on, since i got a knew one). Britney said she was jealous that i had two bestfreinds, and that i wasn't aloud to have another bestfreind.  meanwhile she had three other bestfreinds. ofc this time i didnt listen to her. my other bestfreind made me realize what britney was doing. she asked if i ever had treid to 'break up' with Britney, and i said yes. so that day i go up to Britney during lunch and  tell her i don't wanna be freinds anymore. she storms of to the bath room.

"yo fuck the internet just tell me how to die jesus christHoly fuck every single response to any question about suicide is a ""dont do it"" story. I look up methods to kill myself because my idea of the diving off a high up abandoned building is hard to do because it's hard to found a building high up enough to result in death instead of breaking my neck or legs and just being in pain. I guess I could just break a window,  I don't really need to be on a rooftop? Though I'm way too much of a pussy to both break a window AND jump off, let alone just the one.

The ones with the boyfriends, the ones in clubs, the ones passionate about their career and future. The ones eager to live life. Those ones specifically I want to kill. The one thing they’re soooo happy about and excited to wake up everyday. And the normies. I want to kill them all, and let their friends watch. And then kill myself. I would kill the inconsiderate teachers too. But only the ones who failed me last year. The stupid fucking neckbeard with his stupid fucking drawings who plays children’s video games on steam like a fucking child. And the stupid fucking arrogant teacher who I will not specify, because you never know. Oh, and he has a son too.

"What happens at outpatient therapy? What about inpatient?So I'm going to be 5000 percent honest about me.

I'm in the army, I'm 21, and I just can't stop these suicidal thoughts, ideations, and circular thinking.

My life doesn't seem terrible but something something brick by brick blacked out all the sunlight something something. 

I constantly feel like I'm holding it together for other people and never myself. But this sucks, and my brief months in therapy and on antidepressants haven't helped enough.

When I go into therapy in March, I'm 99% sure I will be committed and begin a long process of waiting to get medically discharged from the army.

Makes me feel like such a shit head, but people keep telling me being honest to my provider is what's best. It's just, how do I face people?

My commander and 1SG are definitely going to come check up on me while in the hospital. Failed them.

I'll have to move back home to my parents and explain the situation. Failed them.

My co-workers will wonder what happened. Failed them.

I signed a piece of paper when I was in a bad place hoping to find some purpose. It didn't work and now I'm just a big leech surviving on the governments dime.

God I hate myself so much. I hate having to censor what I say. I hate not being able to express how I feel. I hate feeling ashamed for trying to take care of myself.

I just wanna know what to expect at inpatient/outpatient.",suicidal,high

"I Thought About ItEdit: I'm a 15 year old girl.

Here's a quick autobiography of myself:
My mom legitimately wants me dead, my dad doesn't give a fuck about me, my siblings all hate me, I have no offline friends, my online friends don't care to talk to me anymore, and I honestly don't see the point in life. Heck, I never even saw the point. I don't even have a goal for my future. I only continued to live because I thought things would get better, but it never did. I also get bullied at school, however, the bullying has stopped this year. People make fun of my weight, appearance, personality, behavior, and accuse me of being rude when it's actually my social anxiety and depression.

How this decision came to be was because my mom told me that she hates me and wants me dead. That was what made me consider suicide. I'm pretty sure that's my only option. No one will care, anyway. Like I stated in my bio, no one gives a fuck about me. I'm done, I don't want to have to go through this crap anymore. I would ask my older brothers to take me to a psychiatrist, but they'd judge me/make fun of me, and the psychiatrist won't care about me. It's his/her job. They only care about the money they'll get for ""treating"" someone. In the end, I told myself I'd give myself one more month, and if it doesn't get better, then I'd kill myself.

I'm only posting this because I thought I'd do the sensible thing and talk to someone about this first, however, since this is public and anyone can view the comments, I want to talk to whoever on Skype only. I know not everyone has one, but at least it'd give me some privacy. My Skype's ღ яσßσcħµµ ღ if you actually care enough to bother with me. I don't do video/voice calls because I have low self-esteem. Besides, I share a room with my younger sister, so it'd be a problem for her to bug me.

Don't bother adding me just to talk to me, then ignore me after you've ""fixed"" me. People have done that before, and it only made things worse because I have an abandonment issue that I never got resolved. I'm not trying to force you into being my friend or whatever. I don't know. I'm just talking nonsense again. I tend to do that when I'm upset. I'm sorry.

I'm really sorry to everyone for being a useless, pathetic idiot. I know I'm being really annoying right now, but I don't know. I don't know how to fix myself.",suicidal,high

I have two young kids. So I'm holding on to my personal moral objections harder than anything else right now.

That said... I want to die. I think about it all the time. My life has gone to shit and I just want it to end. I'm getting a divorce, my new relationship is a constant source of stress because I'm trying to hide my depression from him, I'm barely keeping myself motivated in school, I'm very nearly blind and facing the prospect of an eye surgery that risks blinding me, I can't make enough money to support myself freelancing because I'm overwhelmed by waves of anxiety and apathy by turns, I'm supposed to be getting my own apartment soon and I've never lived alone, I'm in pain all the time, I'm constantly isolated because of the whole almost blind/can't drive/stay at home parent thing.

I found myself laying in the tub debating how I could kill myself that would be easiest for the EMTs to deal with and came to the conclusion that even in death I'd be too much of an inconvenience and burden to bear so I'd better not.

I've started cutting and clawing at my body because I am so angry at it, how could it do this to me? I'm tired of being laughed at, I'm tired of men mooing or oinking at me when I go out (this actually happened today, a group of guys did it from their vehicle), it happens very frequently;almost every time I go out; so I rarely leave my home anymore.

It doesn't help I have to walk with a cane. I've been contemplating suicide and fantasizing about it so much lately. I used to say that my son was the one keeping me alive, I need to live for him but now I feel like he would be better off without me.

I don't want to work just so I can survive to work yet another month. I will never sell my mind to someone or something I don't believe in. And this alone is enough to be an outcast, both socially and professionally. I find it weird how we prevent people from killing themselves yet all follow and support structures that beat them to it without even realising it. Not like I have an answer, the past, present and future key to our survival is a well functioning and productive society, not the well being of free radicals. But I have to add that depression isn't an illness, the norm is. Depressed people are more likely to realistically judge a situation.

I'll try once again, and maybe a few times after that. But after a fixed age, and without any solid improvement, I'm just going to call it quits. I'll have years upon years of proof that life isn't worth it. I won't be repeating the same experiment and expecting different results.",suicidal,high

"Something wrong with my faceBasically the biggest obstacle of my own adult life has been my own face. I can rarely get it to look normal/not unhappy. I have all kinds of weird tensions and it moves weird, when I think about it I just see weird floating objects. Nothing seems to make sense about my face. I have the energy to do other things but I’ve had to shut down about a million opportunities because I just know I’ll look weird and off\-putting to others.

Girls are just kind of out of the question, for now. There’s always hope things could change and get better I guess. But for about a year now I’ve wanted to go see this girl but I can’t only because my face \(my whole body I guess really needs a lot of work, but mainly my face\). I’ve tried exercising, eating better, stretching, living in a different place, making music, learning some new stuff, psychedelics, even had a little girlfriend for a while to prove I could do it/act normal, a lot of self\-care, staring at my face for hours, meditation, even a form of therapy. 

I’m just sick of seeing myself. Hearing myself. Being myself. Putting people off wherever I go it seems like. I’m an outcast pretty much and I pretty much feel like killing myself lately.

"I can't come out to my family.Hi, I made a new account to post this because others would find out from my main account and I really don't want that to happen. Anyway, for around five years, I've kept a large sercret from my family. I'm bisexual, but much more attracted to the same gender. So, I come from a relatively great family- minus my mother. My grandmother, who I'm extremely close to, has said numerous times to everyone in my family that if anyone was gay that'd she wouldn't particularly mind and that she'd still love any of us. That was great to know, until I found out that she actually doesn't support gay people at all. My father is an incredible guy, but he makes jokes mocking gay people often. It makes it a little bit harder to talk to them about all of this when they're like this.

I managed to open up to my friends about it around a year ago and they were extremely supportive, which is very odd for them, but after high school we all grew apart and I've cut off all connections from them. I have no one to talk to anymore. There's so much building up in my life, including this, and it's becoming too much. I don't want to spend the rest of my life like this.

"Coming up with reasons to feel worseI’ve been on antidepressants for about 4 months. I feel better but I find that most of the time I feel empty. I can hardly keep a coherent train of thought going, especially when it comes to things I used to think about when heavily depressed without meds. 

I feel empty but overall I’m doing alright I guess and not having as many suicidal thoughts.

Yet I still feel sad and it feels like I have no right to be. I have no reason to be. Nothing is even going on.

So i find myself purposefully thinking bad thoughts in hopes that they will make me feel the way I used to feel without meds. So that I have some justification for feeling bad.

Now that I’m on meds and dont feel as bad as before I feel like I have no right to talk about myself feeling sad for no reason considering that it’s nowhere near as bad as it used to be.

"Family saved me and they don’t know itI apologize if my writing ‘style’ is choppy, I have disassociation-derealization and it messes me up a lot on terms of lengthy paragraphs

Posted a few times in the past but was more in the moment. Recently moved to new schools which meant new curriculum, failing classes, practically no friends (not that I had many before in the first place), and falling behind. Thought I would do better at a new school because I was being bullied at my previous. Didn’t get bullied at the new school, but have been going through a rough patch for the past few weeks because of my grades. This is the most classes I’m failing at a time. Anyways, I have never actually attempted until I moved schools because of stress. This was my third attempt (first about two weeks ago, second yesterday) and I’m so glad I chose not to do it. 

I prepared everything; I made a video of good, funny memories for my family to watch when I’m gone, I wrote letters, I put everything in order. I was sitting in my bathtub with a running hair dryer in one hand contemplating when I should do it because someone was supposed to come soon. I was at the verge of submerging it when I suddenly received a facetime call from my younger sister. I ran out of the bathtub with two towels wrapped around me and I told them I had just taken a bath. My younger sister, older sister, and mother were there. Mom knew why I had moved schools because I felt that it was too (blank) and she talked with me for a few minutes over the call, they all did. Asked me about homework and if they were taking up my time. They didn’t know that I was going to kill myself at the moment but they said their “I love yous” like usual. After the call I began bawling my eyes out and I just figured I really can’t leave my family. I’m not gonna die because I’ll feel like I’ll hurt my family too much at such a good time in their lives. They recently purchased a nice house after living in poverty for years and life has been perfect for them. The next few months I have birthdays (sister and dad) and I don’t want them to feel depressed. This Saturday I’m gonna talk to my doctor to be prescribed to antidepressants and whatever and my mom has offered if I wanted to talk to a psychiatrist in the past about other problems which might help. 

On the bright side as well I donated money to organizations (that one with Humans of New York)  because I never had the chance and my failing grade in the hardest class I have ever taken (Dramatic? I don’t think so) bumped up. It’s chemistry. On the down side though my hair is fucked because I impulsively cut my hair into bangs so there’s that, but I guess it’ll grow back over time. 

TDLR; Mom told me she loved me (like she always does), asked how school was going, and if I needed anything I can just let her know. It really changed my decision and I’m not gonna try to commit suicide anymore. I knew they would obviously be sad but they would be devastated if they found out. Moral of story: sometimes it doesn’t hurt to talk to someone. Reach out when you can. ",suicidal,high

"I'm tired of hearing this. I've been talking to the Samaritans, some people who talk to people who are thinking of killing themselves. I was hoping they'd say something different, that they'd say something that would somehow make it all come together, but they say the same things everyone else says. It'll get better. Dig deep, find courage to move on. It'll get better.

I've had these thoughts for the better part of a decade. I'm supposed to believe that its just a bit longer, even though my life has been steadily curving down? 

It seems like every day, i notice something is gone. Food doesn't taste the way it used too. its all bland. Music falls flat to me. Comedy doesn't make me laugh. The games that used to excite me now bore me. And every time i fall asleep i still feel tired when i wake up. 

I'm supposed to believe it'll all just go away? That it will all just snap back, and i'll be happy? I don't even think I remember what it feels like, anymore. 

Some people tell me, well, it doesn't happen on its own. You have to do it. 

Do what? Wave a magic fucking wand and change the fact I have no prospects? that I'm poor, and i'll never escape that because i'm already in debt and i have no job, and no education to get a real job, and no means to get a education? And that's the just tip of it.  

Some people say i should be on medication. But even if i popped down enough Rx to fill me full of sunshine, it'll be a lie. I'll still be a dirt poor, ugly, worthless fuck. ",suicidal,high

"I just feel like I’m waiting to take my own lifeEach night is the same:   

I ponder my issues, how insurmountable some are, how easily tackled others are.   

I wonder how much I’ve screwed up my life. I’ll be 24 in a month. I’ve never worked much, save for a few month stretch where i worked eighteen, twenty hours day. I’ve ruined my academics through drug use, I’m still trying to finish a degree. I’m literally six credits shy, and I can’t muster the motivation to go to my classes. I ask myself, *what’s the point? I won’t find a job anyways.*  

I wonder if it’s too late for me, both academically and personally. I’ve got skme issues that necessitated an early intervention, and I’ve waited too late on them. I wonder if my drug addictions, the things I once used to escape my reality, won’t allow me to solve my reality, if I won’t be able to escape them now. I’ve been binging on cocaine for upwards for four months now, but I guess everyday use ceases to be a binge.  

I wonder why i have no one. I know most people say that and don’t mean it, they’re just histrionic or discounting the numerous people that show love for them in their day to day life, but for me it’s true. I am entirely alone. There can be two, three day stretches where I don’t say a single word to another human being. I’ve lost all my friends either because of the drugs, or because they find me “too depressing to be around.” I am where fun, whimsy, and life go to die. In that way, should I not die too?  

I wonder why in any relationship I’ve ever had, the girl has cheated on me. Most recently, multiple times. It’s a combination of factors: I’m a pushover, I have little self respect so they don’t either, and I’m not always fun and flirty to be around the way these hook ups can be. That’s worn down my defenses and my self worth a lot.  

I wonder about the life i have left to live. In all, when i look at my future prospects, i see nothing. I see a college graduate who took a bit too long, I see an addict who will never escape his demons, I see no job prospects, I see struggle, homelessness, hunger, and despair. I honestly feel that, in an effort to avoid pain and struggle, it’s the most rational choice.  

Many of these problems are fixable, but many aren’t. I also wonder, even if I fix these, do I think I’ll be happy? I doubt it. I’ve had an existential crisis since i was 12 about the way this world works: you are born, you go tk school, you go to more school, you work until you’re too tired to do anything for thirty years, you retire, live on a meager income, and die. That sounds... terrible.  

I just don’t think I’m cut out for life. I want to be.

And then I begin to think of okay, if you did it, how would you? Hanging is my preferred method, because of its high success rate. But, if you can’t tell, I like to be certain of things. It’s uncertainty of success and likelihood of pain is too high for me. I hate the romanticized ideal that those interested in suicide don’t mind pain. The opposite is true for me, I want painless. I’ve had enough pain from bullying, disappointment, hating my very existence. Why would I want my last moments to be spent in anguish?  

Next, i begin to wish I had a gun, or the ability to get one. I see myself gripping the handgun, occasionally a pistol, turning the barrel on myself and just starting at it. Would I put my mouth over the barrel? Sucking deaths dick begging to be extinguished? Would I put it under my chin, angling up toward the back of the brain? Would I do the side of the head?  

This mental high doesn’t last long, I’m reminded that i can’t buy a gun, I’ve been hospitalized. It didn’t help, i still thought about suicide with the frequency I always did after the hospital. It just made me wait a little bit.

Then i grow tired, the hours running long as the clock tells me that it’s way too late to try anything, I would probably wake everyone up. Plus, I’m too tired to write a new note or proof read an old one. It’s fitting really, a lazy pathetic sack of Shit is too tired to kill himself. That’s just poetic in a way.  


So, i close my eyes and begin to sleep, envisioning my life if x, y, or z immutable qualities of my existence were different, how much happier and healthy I would be.

I wake up with sun beaming in my window, and blurt out loud, “kill my self, suicide suicide suicide or die,” a form of OCD or Tourette’s I’ve acquired over the years. And so begins a new day, waiting for night to come and hoping I have the energy and imagination to finally pull the trigger, without a trigger.",suicidal,high

"16 y/o, don't see myself making it past 25I first started to notice something wasn't right with me when I was around 10, always felt really awkward in social situations, terrible with confrontation, only had a couple friends and lacked a lot of self motivation and confidence. Wrote it off as just something that I had issues with and needed to work on, but things have only been getting worse. I really, genuinely hate myself more than anything, I don't think a day has gone by where I'm not thinking about suicide. Ironic as it is, my life is probably the best it can be right now. I've got a great group of friends, I'm getting in shape, and I'm dating the girl of my dreams. I've got plenty of food and a comfy bed. I don't think I deserve any of it though. There is always something telling me that I'm inferior, that I don't deserve to be with my girlfriend, that my friends are just faking it, and that no matter what I do I will end up killing myself full of sadness and hatred. It used to be that I had moments where I felt like the depression was gone, that I was gonna be okay. But now even when I don't feel particularly bad like right now I'm thinking about death and how much I hate myself. It's a cycle at this point, one that's slightly moving downward. My normals are getting worse, and my lows even more so. I've just been playing a game with myself, waiting until I hit a low enough point that I actually work up the guts to do it. I'm so tired of everything. I've tried multiple types of pills, tried therapy, tried meditation, tried picking up some hobbies, but I'm never actually improving my mental health. Deep deep down, I don't want to die, just like everyone else. I want to live a happy life, but I'm so tired. I'm not even an adult yet but it has felt like an eternity these past couple years. I'm so tired of these voices in my head telling me I don't mean shit. I'm so tired of feeling like I'm being watched when I'm in public. I'm tired of looking myself in the mirror and wanting to rip my eyes out. I'm tired of living in this fucked up world full of people who don't care about anyone but themselves. I'm tired of waking up every day and immediately wishing I didn't. And most of all I'm tired of my emotions and those who love me holding me back. If I could make myself numb enough to forget about everyone around me I'd do it in an instant. It is the only reason I'm alive right now. I feel like I am in a prison. Built up by myself and those around me. I don't feel hope for the future. I really genuinely do feel like it's a waiting game and I will do it one day. The only reason I'm posting this is because my mental state is relatively stable and I feel the slightest bit of hope that I can find some advice to help me.",suicidal,high

I try to retain myself from feeling in love, but I can't help it.
Trolls: Trolls on the Internet damage me so much. I feel stupid for thinking of them. Maybe it is because I am too kind and I never wanted to hurt anyone innocent. I rethink and rethink and rethink of the negative comments, posts, that my gender is wrong/bad, that my sexual orientation is wrong/bad and I should kill myself, that the amount of friends I have determine how retarded I am, WHY DO I HAVE TO SUFFER ALL OF THIS SHIT?

I was accepted in a great school, but, like people say irl and on the Internet, school is not about intelligence, no, it is totally not because of my intelligence that I was accepted, it was because of my 'efforts' and determination...

"I'm crazyI just feel like I'm going to snap. I don't deserve help because I'm faking it. I'm so close to slitting my wrists right now, but I'm just being dramatic because I'm just a little, stupid kid who got in trouble. It's not child abuse because mom and dad used and use a flat palm and not a fist. Its normal to flinch at literally everything. It's normal that hugs make me want to cry and lock myself in a damn basement for eternity. It's normal that I cut myself, hell, I don't even do it bad enough to leave permanent scars because I'm a pussy. I don't have an undiagnosed attention problem, I just mess around during class too much. I'm clearly not *actually* fucked up, so I might as well just end it all, as I won't anyway because I'm weak and useless, and clearly this is all just for attention and undeserved sympathy. I am not shaking right now, this is obviously not a *real* panic attack, I can still type things out! I've never been in a bad relationship before, it's normal in every way for someone to force you to have sexual conversations with them on the phone while you try to eat dinner. It's normal for someone to threaten to kill, harm, and starve themselves because you want to hang up. It's normal for someone to call you a bitch in every conversation. It's normal for your father to wake you up in the morning calling you a ""whore"" and ""slut"". It's normal to be suicidal, starting at age 11 and to self harm, biting yourself when stressed, starting from as early as you can remember. It's normal to tell your peers in kindergarten that you're stupid and horrible. It's completely average for your mother to sleep with you in bed every night until you have to move out because your 'not abusive dad' gets custody. It's normal for mom to come into your shared room at night and slam your moronic skull into the wall while your grandmother sits and listen to you sob in the other room, afraid to intervene because you could be taken away by your mother and so you could never see her again, simply because you were up too late watching cartoons. yep, normal as can be.

"Very grimI recently moved back to my abusive childhood home for lack of options after my wife cheated on me and played games with my life. I have no friends to speak of, no support financially or emotionally or otherwise, no connections to this place anymore that might help me get somewhere and most of all no will to continue suffering in this mess.

I have been trying to get myself employed so that I can move out and just paint, but because I've been living in a foreign country for 3 years, all my personal references have since died or moved away. I am an enigma, basically, so getting an employer to hire me is proving to be impossible. Given that my fate is essentially tied to my ability or rather inability to get a job, then I really have absolutely no idea what I'm supposed to do. Keep in mind that I'm literally applying for the most common work with no qualifications required. Furthermore, I have basically fabricated my C.V. and tailored it to fit to the jobs I'm applying for. Even lying through my teeth, without references, I can't get a job. Meanwhile, my wife is moving on with her life in her apartment with our cat and her relatively well paid job. Great.

My life has been such a train wreck since the start and I hate this living situation with this wretched woman that I call my mother so much that I am just so unhappy. I'm so fucking unhappy, all day everyday. I can't believe that my marriage went like this and that she turned out to be exactly the same as everything and everyone up until that point. None of it seems fair. It all feels like purgatory. Like some big test or game.

I have a lot of misplaced anger. I've started to feel violent and abusive. This is so out of character for me that I'm actually pretty scared. I am no stranger to anger, but this is different. I am so cold most of the day when I'm not feeling violent. I walk to try to alleviate my problems and while it used to work, it doesn't anymore. I don't know what to do. I feel volatile and dangerous. I feel as if I am doing everything that I should be doing to get myself out of my situation and it just doesn't matter. I am stuck and it's hell. I am so, so, so alone and I despair over it. I go for walks in the dark in the early winter mornings and I just feel like misery incarnate. I just can't escape and I can't relate and I can't get release and I can't seem to get anywhere. I have nothing. I spend 99% of my day alone and 1% of it being pissed off at having to communicate with someone I loathe with every ounce of my being. I fucking hate that I'm back here in this god damn house.

There is pretty much no positives for me for the foreseeable future and if my grandmother wasn't still alive, I would absolutely walk into the woods tomorrow and end it. But as it is, she's still around and I still feel compelled to make her last days not as miserable as my current day-to-day is. So here I am, writing another load of bullshit for a bunch of strangers that have a fleeting interest in something morbid or are equally suffering while looking for an out. I'd offer you an out if I had one, because jesus christ it fucking sucks not having anything or anyone to turn to.

That's all I got. Thanks.",suicidal,high

"It is a world completely sad, where the low sullen skies seem about to rain pure horror from above. (Long post). iI am lost. I’m a 26 year old woman with nothing to show for my life. I barely graduated high school, took time off after because I didn’t know what to do, eventually ended up going to a shady for profit school (Phoenix), because it was easy admission and brick and mortar schools scare me too much. I did end up finishing my AA there in Elementary Ed, which was a complete waste and I have no desire to work with kids or teach them. That has left me with 26k in loans. 

I don’t have any friends. It’s hard for me to get close to people. The only person I communicate with on a daily basis is my cat. 

I have two credit cards in collections (2k total), my credit is awful. The only jobs I have ever worked are retail ones and they go smoothly at first and I think everything is going to come up milhouse, but there is always an issue. I’ve been sexually harassed, I’ve had my hours cut because I spoke up about the negative treatment, I’ve worked in a situation where I was the only one on the registers on a busy sale weekend, and I was trying to go as fast as I can, but the entire time I was being scolded over the radio by my manager for not stocking the food items up front or putting merchandise back. 

I’ve been unemployed since the end of March after I reported the unfair treatment from
the sexual harassment job and HR decided nothing was wrong and implied that I was making it up, so I quit. I’ve tried to search for jobs and have been rejected over and over again. I had a promising interview with a credit card company for a wonderful position, did several phone interviews, and never heard back from them. That destroyed any confidence I had left. I live with roommates and I am grateful that I have shelter, but there’s no money left. I have $40 in my bank account. I do mturk to try and make some sort of money, but it will not be enough for bills I have due in a week. I just have no hope. 

I want to go back to school (I’ve applied to WGU) and I think that is the right decision, but I don’t know if I can make it that far. Both of my parents were addicts and I swore to never follow that path, and I haven’t. But recently I’ve been mixing benzos prescribed to me and alcohol. It’s not enough. It’s not destroying me like I wish it would. I’m just hopeless, I feel like a burden, I’m disappointed in myself. My mother always told me growing up that I was worthless, that I would never amount to anything, that I’d end up alone, and as much as I hate her, she’s right. Mother does know best. 

I just wish I had an opportunity, a chance to change my life, to show someone that I am
capable and smart and a hard worker, but it is just not happening. 

So why try anymore? Why would I continue to live? I’m just a waste. I’m so sorry that this post is so long. ",suicidal,high

"Phantom NoosesI've felt a phantom noose around my neck for the last two week.  I can't walk past any height or railing without imagining how it world feel to jump and have my neck snap as the rope pulls taut or to just hit the ground with a wet splat.  And that scenario gets more appealing each day.

I got fired a year ago, and I haven't had a full-time job since then.  I do part-time work in my field, but it's terrible for me because it's the most boring and stressful work I've ever done.  It's boring because my work barely uses my degree--you could train anyone who can read to do my job--and stressful because there's no guarantee that any assignment will last even half the time the staffing agencies promise, so I have to hustle and send out resumes every day just to keep in part-time work: I'll quit a job that's *about* to end to work on one that's about to *start*.  

I broke up with my SO after two months of this, because I couldn't contribute to the relationship while I wasn't working, and there are plenty of people with jobs who can make my SO happy.   We had always agreed to have an equal partnership, and I can't be my SO's equal if I'm not working.  I also wasn't about to depend on my SO for financial support; we'd both had experiences with exes leeching off of us, and I would rather be alone than a leech.  I've cut down on all my expenses to bare bones: no more hobbies or eating out, sold most of my clothes and books and furniture, no more Netflix or TV or videogames (sold all of those too), only enough Internet to look for jobs, the cheapest data plan my phone company sells, I don't even turn on the lights anymore and I've stopped using AC or hot water.  

I have a history of depression, but no history of suicide attempts.  I don't want to talk to a doctor, because if I told them the truth they'd probably commit me (and then I'd get fired from temp work and stuck with a hospital bill I couldn't afford), and if I *don't* tell the truth there's no point in talking to a doctor.

I don't want to be told that ""things will get better"" or that I'm being irrational or crazy or stupid.  I don't find any of those platitudes helpful, and I know from lurking here all week that these are common enough pieces of advice here, so let me just get that out of the way right now.  I also don't want to here that I need to keep trying doctors until I find one I can trust, because: (a) I can't afford to do that, (b) I *do not trust doctors* after some serious TMI-Fridays trauma the last doctor I saw put my family through, and (c) I've looked up my state's laws on involuntary commitment, and I think my thoughts and urges are specific enough to qualify *and I do not want to be committed*.  

I don't know what I *do* want, though.  A job.  My life back.  But that's not about to happen.",suicidal,high
"The little bully in my headI have a bully in my head, it started out as a imaginary friend I had when I was younger. Then it turned into so much more, and darker. The bully plants ideas in my head, and would threaten me with thoughts that would scare me, “move the box or your sister would trip with the baby” “it would be your fault”. Everyday this bully would hold my hand, and just whisper to me. I’ve been told I have OCD, not sure if I really do have it at this point. I doubt myself a lot. But I just don’t think this is intrusive thought, this thing that use to me so pure and something that was suppose to keep me company. Turned into something so dark, and toxic. 

I grew up in a toxic household, I don’t think it’s so bad now. I’m not sure I’m just kinda put to the side, when needed. I’ve been showered with expensive gifts to make me “feel better” and “stop hurting myself”, of course that doesn’t make anything feel better.  Sometimes my family does make me insecure, and question my decisions but I don’t really care. I’m the type of person who would give it there all in a friendship or relationship, but if you leave my life then you’re gone forever. I try so fucking hard not to let other people see me at my lowest, I hate being seen as weak. I’ve always been the one to be reasonable, and more mature. I’m always the listener, and the one you can cry one. But the question is, who can I cry one. Who can I vent to, who would listen to ME. I’ve always had a wall up, blocking me from people that could hurt me. I don’t want to be used to hurt, my parents always said there’s no such thing as friends. 

Life is getting too hard to handle, everyday I’m filled with guilt and terror. I’m scared of trusting anyone, cause I know they’ll leave me. I know other people have it worse, hell other people are being hit by parents or friends. I know, and that fills me with the most guilt. I still cut, I stop when I have a doctors appointment. I don’t want people to stop me, I know this isn’t healthy but it’s what I deserve. I don’t want to disappoint anyone, and when I talk I feel like it’s life or death. I can’t handle life, I don’t want to live. I don’t want to deal with people, I don’t want to wake up in the morning in terror of last nights nightmare. I want to end all of it, and I don’t even have a solid reason. I feel trapped by my own mind, but I don’t want to let go. Cause this is the only comfort I’ve had, cause this bully in my mind was my first friend. I’ve tried to take my life before, but they were useless attempts. I’m expected to be better cause I take pills, I feel shamed cause I’m on pills. I am mocked and irritated by my family, I feel shamed even if I know it’s a joke. I was hit or pinched as a child, by my family and it did leave a big mark in my life. I don’t blame anyone if I were to end up dead, I’m just waiting for the right time. There’s so much more I could say, but I think I’m just being dramatic.

Anyone got advice, honestly I’ll take anything st this point.",suicidal,high

"Came close to tryingHad to get the money together to buy out my wife's part of the house. Now my mortqage is up by $370 a month. I also have to pay her support. I'm starting a new job next week where I feel I'll basically be working to pay mortgage and support. I feel so unmotivated to work now.

Early this morning I woke up and got a bottle of rye, opened it up and started drinking it straight. Picked up a bottle of sleeping pills, poured a few in my mouth, tried to swallow but only a couple went down. Got scared, and spit the rest out and went to sleep for a couple hours.

I'm on a wild rollercoaster. Sometimes I feel ok, sometimes I feel like I have to get out, but I""m just too scared to make that final decision, which stresses me out.

I've budgeted my regular expenses and I'll be open... after all expenses are paid (no savings, just utilities, food, gas, NOT clothes), I'll still have $700 a month for other stuff (well, $400, but I want to cash in a few thousand of my RSP to pay off my car which frees up $300). This other stuff would be incidentals like clothes, household items, repairs, and fun stuff.  Up until now money has never been that tight, I've been working high tech and was married to a woman who also worked lower paying jobs but which still helped so much (hence me owing her support for income disparity). But now not only am I alone (but would be quite comfortable on this salary), I'm losing $1000 a month.

She's probably tight too.

Am I overreacting to how tight I'll feel?

I have to admit, I see other friends working similar jobs talking about buying stuff, travelling, etc and I feel like I want to be able to have money to do that too.

Basically my financial situation is what seems to be pushing me over the brink the most and that's why I went into it here.

If anyone wants to kick me in the ass and say I shouldn't be whining about the numbers I have, I am open.

Edit: Rereading this, I hope I don't come across as a douche. I'm not greedy, I don't want to drive the fanciest cars. My motivation for having money on hand is for being prepared for the unknown, I have great fear of the unknown. So I store away money for that rather than blow it on extravagant things.",suicidal,high

I always end up feeling guilt and abandonment so fast for no reason. I go through these issues alone and would rather make myself uncomfortable than confront anyone or express my real opinion. That’s why a lot of people think I’m too nice and shy.

I met a group of people around late summer 2019 on a reading app called Wattpad. We mainly got close but I still remember feeling abandoned by them because of my distance to most of them. They counted me as one of them (or said so) even though I was rarely there. I’ve only started being active and helping always keep the groupchat alive when the quarantine started. 

A month later or so I met my now bestfriend and girlfriend and she grew a lot on me. I wanted to introduce her to them, because (believe it or not) I counted them as family and wanted to share my happiness with them. 

Later on around the end of 2020 two girls of them started getting really careless about what was discussed in there and what ppl came to them about, they only cared about sharing posts and favorites some people, not my girlfriend who I tried to make a part of this gc that I idolized. 

She then told me that they absolutely disregarded her situation, feelings and kept joking with each other and trying to be so funny about it and make it seem like it was a common thing to joke about. They only saw her as piece to hang on me and not as a member of ‘us’. So she came to me and asked if I would be upset if she left the gc. I completely supported her and we didn’t say anything to them. A month or half a month later, on New Years, one of them noticed and everyone started calling her a traitor, etc. 

I was really disappointed with them so I kept silent and then they came to me and I played dumb. So they just ignored it and ever since I’ve tried to play along as if I didn’t mind but I don’t know what to do. It was my birthday today and yet only one of them wished me in there and the one (who was always nearest to me) just read the conversation.

I don’t know what to do anymore
Maybe it’s me, the toxic one, not them. 
I hate myself for that.

"EvilAfter a long, strenuous four years I finally decided it was best for my gf and I to break up. We had a crazy past filled with highs and mostly lows. Before the break up I attributed this to normality. I'm not trying to take away from the time we had, and being this wss my first real relationship I decided to keep going much longer than I should have. 

I only have one friend, and we have been close from age 12-23. He always tried to be there for me when he could, as did I. About a year into my relationship with my girlfriend I sent Snapchats out to a female and received some as well. My gf found out not even two months later from my best friend's ex after those two broke up.

This happening two days before her parents divorce, set her on a destructive path, but still having to rely on me for help. I lived with her at her parents place at this time so it was a big change for the whole house.

Since my friend lived an hour away from his job, and I lived much closer, the newly single friend basically moved in. Things were rocky for the rest of that whole summer.. I slept 11-12 hours a day and worked just to come home to an unhappy house. The last day before my gf and I moved she totaled my car at 4am, with my best friend in it. I left the vehicle around 1am because of fighting. So who knows what really happened.

Fast forward to two months ago. I broke my girlfriends heart and told her all of our problems would never go away, and things only got progressively worse through out our relationship. We had a puppy together, she kept it. 

A few weeks ago my friends gets a text from my ex simply stating she always loved him and thought they had a special connection. Her mother believes she is simply saying her goodbyes as a friend, but she didn't even tell me she loved me or goodbye. In fact, she told me she was ""pretty much raped...he said all the right things"" and then have me his name. I blocked her instantly, knowing any further conversation would surely lead to insanity.

I saw her tonight, not even 10 feet from the same guy she was talking about. And I haven't seen my friend for almost two weeks, it's almost as if he feels some sort of way. He tried to tell me she wasn't for me many times, but I never believed him.

Any feedback would be greatly appreciated. She has turned me inside out, and all I wanted to do was the right thing. I'm mentally exhausted and I just feel like my life has no meaning now. Everything I have let in has destroyed me. I'm afraid if I don't end myself I will end up hurting others.",suicidal,high

"WHY YOU SHOULDN'T THINK WITH YOUR PENIS So I am 18, I have lived by myself officially since 16 ( Aussie) I struggled with homeless and ended up in a studio apartment in the city which is pretty decent not gonna lie. Anyways I have this one REALLY REALLY REALLY hot neighbour....like her ass IS FUCKING INCREDIBLE. For about 2 years i never said anything until one day all my friends that are neighbours weren't there and I desperately needed a phone with credit to text someone, I ended up knocking on her door... I asked for her phone and she said sure and I said I would talk about 2 mins, so she said "" would you like to come inside?""...

My 18 year old brain IMMEDIATELY completely forgot about what I was doing and because of fucking Hollywood... My teenager brain thought ( ah so the hot neighbour girl finally asked me to come inside, so judging by Hollywood movies imma bout to get some crazy sex). But this is reality, it took me 3 mins to realise I fucked up really bad....it turns out.......she's a fucking Jehovah's witness and this is a completely 100 percent true story.... I sat there for 3-5 fucking hrs listening to some bullshit about fucking jehovah.. I WATCHED THE FUCKING SUN SENT OUT OF HER WINDOW.

That's not even the worst part... I walked into her apartment expecting to get laid... And after 3-5 hrs I walked out with an alternative version of the holy bible....


Fuck. My. Life. A god literally prevented me from getting laid.",normal,low
"I WILL die a virgin. I will not experience life's purpose. I will never know love..I haven't been diagnosed but I am 99% sure I am autistic. It runs in my family and I show almost all of the traits. This means I can't understand how to socialise normally. I have no idea how to have a conversation and I come off as creepy and weird.

.I also have crippling anxiety. I physically can't talk to girls or people I don't know too well, and if they talk to me first my heart rate shoots up and I start shaking and panicking. I have never stood up for myself or my friends against bullies, only frozen up in fear. I am a coward.

.I am emotionally unstable. I have self harmed multiple times in the past. I once cut myself under the desk in class. I am a huge overly sensitive pussy. If someone so much as insults me on Reddit I will have to fight back tears. If I'm not around people I don't know I am prone to going into fits of rage over the slightest thing. I frequently have fantasies of ultra violence, such as torture and genocide.

.I have probably ruined my ability to have sex. Firstly, sexual repression has led to me becoming hyper sexual and addicted to porn. I masturbate multiple times daily, my record being over 20 times in one day. If somehow I had the chance to be intimate with a woman I probably won't be able to get it up. Secondly, I have been prone masturbating since I was a toddler and have ruined my penis. I have pretty severe phimosis. I will have to get a circumcision at some point but even then I've probably ruined my physical ability to have sex.

.I have a pathetic personality. I have no motivation to do anything, even things I know are important such as studying. I have absolutely no talents or skills. All I do is sit around daydreaming about bullshit and eating junk food. Yet the thought of actually doing something about it physically hurts.

.Ugly face and a fucked up body. I have dozens of medical conditions that would repulse women and my body is shaped abnormally.

.I am physically pathetic. I can barely benchpress the bar itself never mind any weights. I'm 6 foot 2 yet weigh only 65kg and I have zero stamina or athleticism.

I am disgusting, pathetic, worthless, evil and subhuman. I will never know love, or sex or passion. I want to die so badly, the only reason I haven't is because I am a coward. I deserve death. I want someone to burst into my room and shoot me. I just want to die.",suicidal,high

"I hate my birthday. My life is looking darker as the years go byThis literally just came to mind I’m turning 20 in 2021(February)and I don’t look forward to it. My first memory of me on my birthday was when I was 4 my parents took me to the movies to watch racing stripes, to be honest I was a mischievous child I won’t sit still and ran all over the cinema. My dad then grabbed my arm and pulled me out of the cinema yelling at me I’m crying, he then took me to the car and locked me inside and went back to finish the movie. I’m sitting in the car crying with no windows opened after we went home he “disciplined” me. To this day I even remembered what he said “ I don’t care if it’s your birthday, I will plaster you against that wall (we had concrete walls)”as I’m crying because of the belt marks on my back he screams “ don’t you dare talk back to me I promise you, if you carry on you will die tonight”. My birthday this year all I wanted was to relax and watch T.V I couldn’t even do that I spend the whole day doing my brother’s (15) project, not helping, DOING. None of my friends even called or texted me happy birthday(on my birthday in 2018 - last year of high school, the last time even heard from my friends no one even wished me and we all where ID cards that display our D.O.B), maybe because I wasn't one of the popular guys, I'm always the one getting left out. I actually found out my friend group had a group chat, I never even knew about it. On my birthday this year the whole day was filled with yelling, swearing and violence. I got so angry that I took it out on myself, and that alone just brought back memories of me self harming, I used to cut and burn myself I even tied fish tank tubing to a stick and whipped myself with it. I’m turning 20 next year I don’t know where my life is going, I was meant to finish university next year instead I failed and repeating it, I just feel like I'm wasting everyones time and money.

"The Straw That Broke The Camel's Back...First of all, I'm done with judgement. IF YOU THINK THIS IS ATTENTION WHORING, GET THE FUCK AWAY AND **LEAVE ME ALONE.** I--- I've been here before. Not with this account, but numerous times. I'm... I'm done. I'm 14m (15 in mid december) and I give up. I already fucked up my grades in high school... I'm greedy... I'm a douchebag... I'm annoying... I don't even know how I managed to find a girlfriend. I love her more than anything, because she loves me back... You can call me a terrible person. I laugh at death. I have always found death intriguing, and I'm ready to experience it first hand. My parents are terrible to me... at least that is what I think. My peers judge me... my parents judge me... the only people that actually really understand me anymore are my big sister (28) and my girlfriend of seven months. I've never been diagnosed, but I'm pretty sure I've been depressed since elementary school. I just... I'm done with it. I just want to sleep... sleep forever... sleep through my life.

I just... I can't do this any longer. I can't endure this... I always fear about us... my generation... how we're all idiots... how I feel that only about 15% of us know what to do in a bad situation... I fear my future is black. I fear that we're going to fuck up. I'm afraid because of us.

I'm sorry. My brain is wandering and I am just typing what I think. Everything is a blur... I just want to end it. I figured very soon here I will do it. I will swallow all the pills in our house that I can find, slice my wrists, and then shoot myself in the head.

I just wish that I could go away. I've heard to live your childhood as long as possible, because adulthood sucks. My childhood sucks. I just want to be an adult... this sounds foolish and naive, but I just want to live with her. She's my life. I want to just... wake up and see her. She comforts me. She's the one reason why I don't want to take the plunge into the unknown. I have too much stress in my life. I just wish that I could just... let go. But that seems impossible at this point... The only way to escape the pain is to end it. I've self harmed once, and that was a cut with scissors on my left hand. It didn't hurt... it felt nice. It was an escape. I know there are other ways to cope, but I'm... done. My parents don't even know I'm depressed. The only people that know that are my girlfriend and my best bro from another mother, friends since we were children. I can't do anything. Please... somebody... help. I just... I can't do it anymore. I don't know what to do. I don't want pity posts... I want serious posts. Please, somebody, help me. I don't know where to turn or where to go anymore.

"I took my crush on a motorcycle ride today Today my older brother got a Honda cbf 125 from a friend and I was allowed to drive it.

 So i took it for a ride since it's been a year since my last ride after ~20km I went back home and asked her if she would like a ride since she likes motorcycles too and wants to make her license soon.

She said yes and we went on an hour long drive for about 40km around the town and it was awesome and she loved it too.

I would slowly cut off contact with close friends and distance myself from my family to lessen impact. Not sure who I want to find me though, and I’m not sure how I want to do it yet. Every day is a painful struggle and please don’t tell me it “gets better,” because I was blessed with my fathers crippling depression and my mother’s extreme anxiety.

"Strong urges to kill myselfI’ve struggled with depression for most of my life and recently it has been evolving in a bipolar disorder (diagnosed, but waiting for “official” diagnostic). I also have OCD, ADHD and GAD. The thing is, despite increasing my SSRI dosage, it seems as if I’m getting resistant to them and becoming more depressed as days go by.
I don’t know if it’s because of depression or anxiety, but I feel a drowning emptiness that basically shouts to me to kill myself, when it comes to it I start looking for any weapon in my room or something to make feel better.
It’s like an external force calling me to harm myself/end my life.
At this point I don’t know what to do, I can’t stand that suffocating feeling, I don’t know if instead of killing myself I should start doing drugs or cutting myself. I really want to try keep going, but it sometimes feels like an impossible task to me.
I’m 16 and I have no one I’d like to talk to, I don’t have dreams, desires or goals, I even try to make people hate me (maybe because, if everyone hates me, it’d be easier for me to end my life).
I literally have no reason to keep going other than not to hurt my family.

"Advices neededHi, I've been posting here for 2 or 3 times ish and since after my last appointment with my psychiatrist, I've been doing better, or at least i hope. I've been working extra every day for 2 weeks and since i love my job, it's not a huge issue and i get along better with my colleagues. The only issue is when i went back home for my holiday. 

Usually I've always been scared of it, not because of my bullies or the bad memories that lingers on (it's been resolved a bit with emdr) but because of the family stuff. I have quite an active personality that i made up for myself as a way to not be bullied again. The thing is that whenever i go back, i always have trouble with my family when it comes to my look. My dad says i look like a hideous freak and he's disappointed to see me. Everyone says that they have to suffer from troubles since the day i came back. I know that i need to fix my look. It's so easy to do so. It just that I'm so used to not being worried about looking bad since the day i came to The Netherlands. It's just a hairstyle, but it defined me and makes me feel happier and more confident. I just have a lot of thoughts going on again and I don't ever want to go back to the clinic.

My anxiety is so bad it always gives me phantom pains and I convince myself I’m having a heart attack or a stroke or some shit. I’m only 16 years old. I shouldn’t be living like this. I should be like other girls, just carefree. My anxiety was a lot better for awhile, but it’s taken a turn for the worse and I don’t wanna live with it anymore. All my friends do is get mad at me and it makes me feel SO shitty. I put my parents through so much shit. I’ve had little mini mental breakdowns. I barely have a relationship with my dad. I love my mom so much. All my mom does is worry about me and she does so much for me and i’ve treated her so shitty in the past and it makes me feel like absolute shit. I hate that I always worry her. I know it would just be better if I was dead and gone and didn’t exist because then I wouldn’t be causing her pain. 2 kids that live on my street have killed themselves i know she's scared for me and doesn't want me to feel like that and think i need to commit suicide. I hate that I feel this way. I hate that i just wanna free her from the pain that is me. I don’t wanna feel this way. I don’t wanna feel anymore. I just wanna be gone. I wanna be free from this pain.

"Not too sure I can do this anymoreI've gone through so many 'I'm gonna do it this time' moments, but have never been able to bring myself to actually commit. I feel so alone in this war with myself. Nobody takes me seriously, and I'm not sure how to talk to anyone about what I'm going through because I've heard 'you have no reason to be depressed' from my own family. I've talked to therapists  but I always come out of them with the realization that maybe I'm just being too sensitive about things. There's a part of me that wants to keep fighting  but what is the point? Nobody's life is any different because of me, no matter how hard I tried to be positive for them. In fact, I hinder and annoy people more than I do make people happy, so my last act of goodness can be getting rid of myself for them, right? I have so much love for those in my life, but I realised that they don't feel the same. I know that all it would take to help me is if I had someone to tell me everything is gonna be alright, but I'm so alone I doubt anybody would notice enough to say it.

"Mental BarrierHonestly I've stopped trying to get better; I've been sick coming up 8 years, learnt I was disabled in that time too, and I'm getting tired of waiting it out. For what? So I can just be dependant on my parents for the rest of my life, never achieving anything, because I'm slow instead of sick? There's no 'better' for me, only coping and I don't care for that anymore. I used to fantisize about dying in a natural disaster, or getting hit by a drunk driver- anything that I couldn't be blamed for, until I realised nothing was guaranteed to happen unless it was by my hand. After that the fantasies were about trains, bleeding out, pills. I've become more realistic since then and understand what's more plausible for me, and honestly I feel I'm ready. Mentally, I'm ready. But I just... dont act on it, for some reason. A handful of half-arsed OD attempts, sure, but nothing with a likelihood of success. There's a difficulty, feels like a near impossibility, of taking what's in my head and making it Real. At this point it's all I want, and I feel like even more of a failure for not doing it! I used to be so scared of admitting it, but I've told my doctors that I think of and want it, multiple times, and hey as long as you dont actually do it, not our problem! Since then I don't feel as afraid, because no one can be surprised when/if it happens. The only thing left is figuring out how to remove that barrier, bring what I want and thought about so much into actuality, but I have no idea how to and it makes me hate myself more. Every time I think of it and don't act feels like a personal failure.",suicidal,high

"Depressed Because of OrientationA year ago, I came out to a friend as bisexual. She had come out to me, so I felt comfortable. From there, I began to feel depressed because she was the only person I know, and everybody else I knew was straight. I hate myself because I like my friends - my friends are the kind of people to whom I am attracted - and I know I can never have a relationship with any of them. They're all males, and they would reject a relationship with me - even a non-sexual one - purely because I'm male.

"My wife had a breakthrough thinking about suicideOur daughter took her life last summer, and it threw us borh into the crisis of your lives. Rachel's response was top read up on it. Mine was to find a story that made it make sense. (http://mfinley.com/pdf/zombie-girl.pdf, if you're interested)

Rachel's breakthrouh occurred reading a book called SUICIDE AND THE SOUL, by psychiatrist James Hillman. Hillman's idea is that we all freak out when we hear about suicidal wishes. Like a fire department we all rush to the scene, and seek at all costs to prevent it.

Hillman suggests that the psychiatrist might be wiser to walk with the suicide to the lip of the abyss and stare down into it with him/her.  We still don't want the person to jump, but more than that we want to honor their journey to the edge of nonexistence.

He's just talking about psychiatrists, not folks like us. But there is something to this. Depressed people are not usually helped with chucks to the chin, promises of a better day dawning, good times being just around the corner.

In a way it is better to be a real friend, and acknowledge the pain that has brought the person to the edge. In short, to love that person and his or her struggle.

Some people, Rachel and I decided, including our beloved daughter Daniele, are involved in a dance with death. In a sense, they have already lived their lives -- intensely, often miserably. 

This accounts for a small percentage of those of us with suicidal urges. I'm talking the hard core -- the death's head kids. Daniele was such. When she died there were literally over a hundred plastic and ceramic skulls surrounding her.

Could she be saved? She was saved, once. But she took pains not to be saved the second time. No note, no longing glances -- even though she adored us.

What is the lesson of a kid like that? That suicide is very profound, and deserving of our respect. Sure, we don;t want one another to die. But we all will die. The trick is to know one another, to respect one another, so that when we do die, we aren't entirely by ourselves.

If you see someone having a hard time, don't be too quick with the wise words. Buy 'em a coffee. give 'em a hug. Listen to their story.

I got off the topic of James Hillman toward the end here. It was me talking, not him. I don't recommend reading his book unless you are a real good reader! But you got the gist of it right here.",suicidal,high
"I’m completely aloneI’ve been working so hard on my mental health, I really have. I stayed at a treatment facility for a month, took their pills, filled out their prescriptions, threw out my razors and belts, and even threw out my medication when the thoughts got too overbearing, hell, I even called the suicide prevention hotline number after calling out of work last minute on Friday because I couldn’t handle anything. I talked to the operator for 4 hours, and it helped for 5 seconds. Here I am now, wide awake, in bed, with two feet of space separating me from my partner, a stranger to me now, the 1,000th night beside him, and every night I’m next to him I feel him inching further and further from me in his dreams. I haven’t got friends, I tried using bumble to meet girls in the area but all anyone my age wants to do is get blackout drunk, and my failing health can not withstand that lifestyle. I am estranged from my family and have absolutely nobody to comfort me when it gets bad. I hate my job. I hate my trauma. My PTSD. My inability to voice my emotions to my partner, not like he’d actually care, seeing as he told me the other night that he’s losing passion for me. I don’t even know what the purpose of any of this was, I just feel so fucking empty and worthless and I wish I hadn’t thrown away all of my medication, belts and razors. I’m too tired to fix myself. I’m too tired to keep suffering. So what is it I’m supposed to do, when I’ve tried everything already?

Additional thoughts: While mental health is a part of our insurance program the UCR is 50% of 140% of medicare which means a solo mental health practitioner who will charge in my area $150-$180 a session will only result in a $45-$60 reimbursement and thus a very high out of pocket expense.

"I'm tired of being miserableI hate that the only happiness I can remember experiencing was when I was with my ex-boyfriend, if you can even call him that. It was a long-distance relationship that only lasted 2 months (last year) before he figured out that I wasn’t worth the effort. All I ever wanted in my life was someone to care about me, someone to be there for me when I needed a shoulder to cry on, but most importantly, someone to share my life with. Every day I browse Reddit and a dozen other websites and think of how he would enjoy the stories and videos I found. I think about how nice it was in the beginning when he told me he loved me and stayed up late at night waiting for me to come home. Now all there is in my life is loneliness and depression. I’ve tried so, SO hard to keep my head above water, but I always fall back into this pit of misery. I can’t seem to get over him and move on… I hate knowing I am worthless to him, that he doesn’t think twice about me or care how I am.

My friends care, I know they do… but it’s not enough for me and I hate myself for it. I know they would be sad if I killed myself, but at the same time I know that they would be okay. They have their SO’s, their families… I’m mostly a last resort these days, the person to talk to when no one better is around. I miss being someone’s number one. I feel like I could disappear and nobody would notice for weeks.

I don’t know how to make this agony go away. I’ve been fighting this episode for a few weeks now, but I’ve been depressed since I was about 12 and I'm 24 now. I tried ODing on Tylenol when I was in middle school and didn't do any harm other than making myself vomit. I've always been teased for being fat and though I've tried dieting and exercise I always reach a point where I think, ""What's the point? Even if I were thin I'd still be a loser."" I don’t see the point of continuing to live feeling this way when nothing is ever going to make it better. Nobody is ever going to legitimately love me, I’m ugly, fat, disgusting… worthless to everyone.

"I just can't take certain people. What to do when people make you want to kill yourself?I just had a conversation with someone else on reddit (look in my reddit history for the conversation). And they got really rude in the end accusing me of being 'disloyal' to people who actually have the condition and that I should just get diagnosed and get meds or whatever.

During the whole conversation I kept telling them that I am in the process of getting diagnosed but that I can't get treatment for my condition because no one is educated to actually deal with it. I told them the medical abuse I have been put through in the process but they didn't seem to even read it. I don't even care about the person anymore.

The problem right now is that now I have all these trauma memories and flashbacks all popping up again, and the way they didn't consider anything I was actually writing just triggered even more flashbacks. I was already in crisis before this whole conversation and now I feel even worse. I can't help thinking about all the doctors that abused me and tortured me (due to no education in how to handle trauma victims, especially the DID). And I feel this person on reddit is telling me I'm bad for not wanting that. When they write with what appears to be the assumption that medical staff can do no wrong, then I feel I'm bad for not liking what they did, it makes me feel utter shit. It also serves as a painful reminder that no one in the whole damn country can help me.

I always do this shit. When people refuse to understand my POV, I argue more and more, digging out more and more painful memories out of my brain. Last time I did that, was in the mental ward where they also did that shit.

For reference: my psychologist thinks I have DID (dissociative identity disorder) and PTSD and is in the process of diagnosing it.

Literally the only reason I'm not committing suicide in this instance is because the other people in my head are stopping me. Thank god for them, I suppose. I also don't have anything lethal around me right now... I tried to commit suicide a bit longer than a month ago and was forced to go to the hospital (that's one of the times they tortured me).",suicidal,high

"I'm starting to give upHello, my name isn't something I'd like out here so I am introducing myself as VVV. I'm currently a senior in high school and I've been depressed since about sixth grade. 
 
A little about myself; I am FtM trans and gay, but I have only told others online. I enjoy drawing and my pets but I no longer have the motivation to draw and mainly focus of taking care of my animals.

I've thought about suicide many times and have always backed down because of something. It could be going on vacation or just needing to feed my animals, I just haven't done it yet. I've never had a serious relationship before, and any dating I have done has been online. Most people end up breaking up with me because I get too attached and basically use them as a life line. I have very few friends (by that I mean 3 friends, all of whom are online) and I'm horribly shy.

I'm not sure even if any of this is important but I just want to give up. Just end it all. I don't really have a purpose and I can't motivate myself to do anything.

"Tales of a math teacher [other] So. This year, I’m taking geometry. Let’s call my teachers name Mr. C. Mr. C is actually I’m not sure how old. Anyway maybe early 30s I have no idea. So in just this first quarter we have gone over: Pokémon go, James (Pokémon) cross dressing in a banned episode of indigo league, his spear which he has in the classroom, a giant spring-also in classroom, a bunch of pool noodles and a ball and a plastic egg to demonstrate problems, his weekend adventures ranging from hanging out with his girlfriend to going to Trader Joe’s to mini golfing, his best friend Brad who is his roommate also, and their apartment is apparently not the best but they do own a $125 chess set, and loads of other things. Every day, he would toss a marker to anyone who should come up and answer a bell work. And then he sometimes has people draw something random. Like a turtle surfing. That was once our bell work. Also, on the first day we did a formula that factored in berries and spin and everything to see the chance of catching a Pokémon in Pokémon go. He pulls out his phone, we make the calculation, and then we see him tapping the screen while talking to us. Mr. C: “oh sorry team rocket was just above me so I’m fighting them real quick” 
Oh and once he drew this shape for a problem and then after made it into a creepy face and was like “at least three of you better have nightmares about this” and then after class was like motioning to it then me 

These sound weird now that I type them out but he’s really just jokes all the time and makes it interesting. 

Oh and after he uses the marker he is facing us instead of the board and he always tries to drop kick the marker back into the shelf like drops the marker backwards and kicks behind him. He hasn’t made it. But once he smashed it on accident against the wall and broke part of the cap. And another time he accidentally lost a cap so he just used the marker a ton to use it then I think he found the cap. 

Another time, he talked about how him and Brad went to play basketball at a park and there were some other people so they played with them and one of them was a like 11 year old boy who kept saying that one phrase I can’t remember anyone who reads this who has Mr. C please tell me ok but yeah and the kid was trash talking but obviously they demolished him.

"M/13 my storyYes, I am thirteen, and yes, this is a throwaway, and yes I typically do not like writing, just to get that out of the way. Kinda just want to share my family story, sorry for bad everything, it's late :/

 Here is a bit of backstory. My family has always been a bit left field. My parents have been divorced were married for at least fifteen years beforehand and were divorced since 2010 because of my dad (let's call him joe) cheated on my mother( let's call her Kelly) and for other reasons I don't want to get into. Me, being only 6, did not care in the slightest that mommy and daddy don't ""love each other anymore"". My sister, on the other hand, (let's call her Jenny) was probably traumatized because of it because of her being 2 years older than me. After Kelly and joe got the divorce, things started to go way downhill. My dad'a side has a ton of alcoholics and history with not being the best at self moderation when it comes to alcohol.  After the Divorce, joe started to drink very heavily. Of course, joe had a history with his mother being a total whacko, and for the most part did not have a pleasant childhood. He started to make very poor decisions. My sister has told me stories where he would chase us around and throw empty beer bottles at us. My mother, on the other hand, took her problems head on. She had lots of depression and anxiety the couple of years after, but, bless her good soul, she actively              sought out help for all of her problems, with two young children to take care of also. 
Fast forward a couple of years, and my mother is remarried to my stepfather (let's call him Biden) . Of course , like any jealous exes, joe absolutely despises Biden 
Even though having a girlfriend for being happy with Kelly.
This is when things start to get rough. (Note: this particular incident was in third grade) it was the weekend in June, and we were having a garage sale. I decided it would be a good idea to drill holes into one of my dads shitty cars's snow tires. Of course, I did not know at the time, because I thought they were just random extras because they were in a literal ditch on the side of our house where we piss in. Of course, he is red with anger, so with people watching, grabs me by the neck, choking me, dragging me up 2 flights of stairs, and locks me in my room for 5 hours. He told me if I moved, or even made a peep, he would beat me with a metal bat. Of course, being absolutely petrified, asks if I could go to the bathroom, which he responded with a no. I ended up, humiliated, sitting in my own piss we my dad mocked me.
It is fourth grade, and at the time going to a shitty catholic school. 300 kids, minimum wage all around, rapey priests, the whole kitchen caboodle. I was never the odd one out, or never was I the one people swarmed around to talk to. Enter in my best friend (let's call him Lucas). I met him early that year. We would always talk about schoolwork, how ""mature"" we wore, video games, or jerking each other off ( not the last one. I promise.) Honestly, he probably saved my life at least a dozen times. Then comes summer, where in ninety days, I was going to eat a fifth grader. It was all fun and games until the incidents came. My father caught me in a lie where we were supposed to go to a swimming camp (I already knew how to swim btw) at a public park. I was with one of my cousins at the time, he was just about as dumb as me. Me, being the edgy pre-teen that I was, decided that swimming camp was for nerds, and I decided to skip. When he gets to my cousins house, he noticed that the towels were completely dry. Of course, he is not mad at the spot because my aunt was there and was defending me. Once we got home, however, he made me sit down, got out habanero hot sauce I bought for him as a present, and force fed it to me. At the time, I hated anything spicy, and I also had lots of blisters, so tl;dr ow. Lots of tears, lots of drooling, lots of water, lots of self hated. After that, everything was pretty okay until late April last year. 
By this point, I have lots of suicidal tendencies, depression, self hated, all of that jazz. I was in sixth grade, and I absolutely despised that fucking school. Every day was a living nightmare. Me waking up from dreams in a cold sweat and all of that shit. During this portion of April, we were just finishing up the question science fair, after a months worth of buildup. Note I did go there with a collar because my dad left red marks on me from he grabbed me earlier that evening. Also note: my mother is out of town, and I am at my dads for an entire week. One night, I had two projects due next week, and he wanted to get them all done. Honestly, that night was a blur. I remember my dad cussing at me, throwing me against a wall, putting me outside in my pjs and locking the door, and refusing me food. The cops are called, but it's too late. It's already over. I cried myself to sleep, cut my wrists, tried to let it all end right there. later, my  sister told me that she took a shit load of pills to try to do the same thing as well. I didn't cut deep enough, Jenny threw them up. We stopped seeing joe for 3 months. My sister has not been there for two overnights because of such bad ptsd. The point is, I have always had suicidal tendencies. I have always been a nihilist. My sister bottles things up, and hangs on to every single thing someone does to hurt her. We got through it. We are ok. I hated to admit to someone that I was thinking of killing myself very often. I did it. You can too. I hate to be cheesy, but please don't do it. Thanks for reading.",suicidal,high

There have been times when it was better, but those times never lasted long and I always found myself back in the dark hole. I've never been married but always wanted to. I've never been stable enough to be a good marriage prospect. My childhood was horrible. Parents are cold and cruel. My dad used to tell my brothers and I that he divorced my mom because of 'us kids'. He broke both of my hands. My mom loved saying how much she regretted having kids. Not once growing up did she tell me she loved me. Zero physical attention, ever, that is unless it was a beating with a hotwheel track or coat hanger. Neither parent has a shred of empathy or compassion. My life has been a total disaster. 

In addition to mental problems, I also have a torturous chronic illness that makes sleep damn near impossible. Cancer survivors who have the same disease as me almost unanimously said they'd rather deal with cancer. It's absolute torment. I haven't been able to work for over a year and a half. For me, work as always been the best treatment by far. I love being productive and having a place to go and structure in my day. I would love to again but I am just too damn sick. My disease is getting worse. I was really passionate about my career. I somehow managed to earn a graduate degree, which is noteworthy because I am a high school dropout. My sole purpose right now is taking care of three dogs. I can't leave them behind but I am worried the pain is becoming too much. I endure daily abuse but must put up with it because I have nowhere else to go. Not only that, but these dogs are the closest thing to a family I have. 

I don't know where I am going with this. Daily abuse, medication side effects, extreme sleep deprivation, not being able to work, running out of money, constant unremitting despair and physical torment from my disease. It's too much. The despair and sadness is deep and just being conscious is hell. I am approaching 50. I wish I could find these dogs a loving home and finally be free to end the misery.",suicidal,high

I hate myself. I am trash. Pathetic. 
But I'm doing everything right and supporting the ppl in my life that care about me.
 I think I care about them. I'm supposed to. I'm just numb.
Sometimes I want to cry. Other times I want to die.
I want to be something like happy. It seems like a myth. Happiness is that mask people hide behind when they're scared of exposure. Fake smiles and empty eyes.
I feel alone. I'm not. I am loved, I know. But I don't feel it. Just a weariness thats been tugging at me for a long time now.
I have made no plans to commit suicide, but its there on the fringe of my thoughts.
My happiness is simply when I forget to hate myself.",suicidal,high

"I'm about to kill myself or my dadAs the title says I'm so fucking close to either killing myself or my dad. He's always treating me like shit and more like I'm just something he can whatever the fuck he wants with just because he gave birth to me. He micromanages my life and doesn't give two flying fucks what I think/want/feel. As long as he gets his way then he's happy. If i try to reason with him at all it's like I'm the fucking worst ever and i just killed his best friend or some shit. He knows quite well that I have severe depression and that I've attempted suicide well over 20 times but he doesn't give a shit. Funny thing is is that he is the reason I want to die. I've even cut myself down to the fat on my arm and he just blames it on me wanting attention or some shit. He never owns up to the fact that he's a piece of shit. Now despite being as bad as some of the worst scum ever to live he does still provide physically for me when he can afford it. But the problem is is that he regularly can't afford it and then stresses out and takes it out on me. Because of this I've attempted suicide about 26ish times to no avail (obviously). For the most part I've been able to handle by cutting or drugs (I'm a bit of a chemist and make my own) but that doesn't really work anymore. I've tried therapy and pills but they don't do shit anymore either.
So now for my big issue and the whole reason I'm going to fucking lose my mind. I'm 17 and I'll be 18 in about 2 weeks so I'll be legally allowed to move out and he can't do shit about it; However I have no money, no job, no education to get said job (still in high school), my grades are so shit i can't go to university or college, I have no personality, I'am a fucking asshole to everyone without trying, and I have no ""legal"" skills. So my dad is making me either go to university or get s job. But my grades are shit so uni is out of the question and even if they were decent and I got accepted I have no money to pay for it. And as for getting a job, I have no personality because I spend all of my time in my room so no ones going to want to hire me. My dad has said that if I don't do either then he's going to kick me out. But I have nowhere to go so I'd be homeless with no money. I'd be fucked and honestly better off dead at that point so instead of having to go through that I'd rather just kill myself. My only other option (not really an option, just me losing my FUCKING MIND at my dad) is killing my dad and then killing myself.
FYI there are people who give a shit about me (grandparents) but they can't afford to look after me until I can afford to live on my own.

TL;DR My dads gunna kick me out and I have nowhere to go, I'm gunna lose my mind and commit a murder-suicide, wtf do I fucking do.

My body’s survival response freaked out and I couldn’t get myself to be suspended for more than two seconds- although it would have been short and painless.

As for the pills I swallowed in a fit, I didn’t even throw them back up. I’ve been feeling a dull ache in my right side, but it could be my imagination or placebo effect. 

I’ve been sleeping an obscene amount and every time I wake up, I’m disappointed that I’m not dead.

Stick a gun into my mouth

"Giving upI’m 19 years old, 7500 in debt to friends and family because of a gambling addiction, they think the money I lent them is for school. I have no way of getting that money back to them. I haven’t been genuinely happy in seriously about half a year. I hate everything and nothing brings me happiness for more than a few seconds. One of my family photos shattered when it was in my suitcase on a flight, probably from the bag being thrown around. I took it out and put it on my counter and it sat there for a few days. One of the days I saw one of the large shards of glass and it sent chills through my whole body because I knew I was that close to grabbing the glass and just killing myself then and there. The only thing keeping myself from doing it is knowing that it will tear my family apart. Every day tho I’m inching closer to just doing it. I’m ashamed and embarrassed of myself. I feel empty, and genuinely sad and worthless more and more every day. I’m so sick of everything and I don’t want to be alive at all. People think my life is so amazing and interesting because I moved away from home to pursue my dreams, and I’m very good socially and make lots of friends easily. But now I’m back home because of the virus, and honestly it’s just making everything worse because I don’t leave my house, I don’t talk to anyone right now because I don’t want to, and I’m just in my head all day every day thinking about the debt I’m in to my family and friend. And how there’s no fucking way I’m going to be able to pay it back. Not even sure why I’m writing this, not really even a call for help. I don’t want help. I just want everything to stop.

I even know how I am going to do it. I've thought it through for the past few weeks if not months. It will be clean and simple and my family will have an easy way of finding out. 
It's honestly crazy to see the words as I'm typing them. Like living a dream that you know you have had before. I've been here for a while now. Stuck in this place of square wheels and uphill climbs. The mind is amazingly complicated for something that you have known your entire life.
I suppose the worst part is that I don't have a sad story. I come from a perfectly normal loving family. Nothing about my childhood would indicate that I would take my life a few months short of my 24th birthday. My parents love me. My sisters love me. I know my friends love me. But I don't love me. Believe me I've tried. But at some point you hit a wall and its okay to not want to climb that wall. Fuck that wall. I have a way out.
This weekend was great. My sister had her engagement party and my nephew got baptized. I'm not religious in any way but its nice to get the family together one last time I suppose. I don't have a problem with it. But the whole weekend I just felt like a fish out of water. I have not felt comfortable in my own skin in years and I'm tired of it. All I hear is ""your brother is so smart!"" and ""Your brother is so handsome he has really grown up!"" ""What a great guy!"" 
Fuck that and fuck you. You have no what I'm going through. All you care about is is he minding his p's and q's and does he look acceptable. You don't care about the real me. If you did you would see that I've been screaming in a glass box for the past few years only to have the echos scream right back. 
I've been on this subreddit before. I'll readily admit many of you are way stronger that I am or ever will be. I admire you for that. I admire you for living though a shit storm and making YOUR choice about YOUR life. I'm about to do the same for me.
There is a road in the back roads by my house that I know. A buddy of mine and me would always go back there to smoke a bowl. One of the places that's hiding in plain sight. I'm going to go there one night, wrap my head in a blanket, and shoot myself in the head. 
I want and open casket funeral because my mom would like that. Keep it simple though. No frills. Bury me someplace with a view that's quite. I'd like that.
I suppose what I will miss the most is threefold 
1. Not seeing my sister walk down the isle
2. Not seeing my nephews anymore
3. Not graduating college. I wish I finished earlier
My heart is pounding as I'm writing this because I know it is real. These are real thoughts, real emotions, real attitudes that I cant fake anymore. 
There are over 7 billion people on this planet. Sure some will miss me but for how long? A few months? Years? Decades? Even in that case I'm going to get forgotten anyway so why not go out on my own terms. I want to be deleted so I'm going to delete myself. Its my right and my option. I'm not even sure why I'm writing this. This will get buried in a pile and no one will ever be the wiser to poor old me. And that's fine. A lot of deeds go unnoticed. If you have gotten this far than thank you. You have a rare look into a suicidal persons last thoughts. You now know that it could be anyone. Even the guy you thought would never be so rash and bold. But its real.

I’ve known him for 3 years know and I guess you can say we’re best friends but in the last year or so every message he sends is casually joking about suicide and it worries me ever so much. He’s always been a hot topic kid, liking hard metal like Marilyn Manson, children of bodom and bring me the horizon, bands like that. 


It might be really stupid of me to say, but over the years i’ve grown to love him. I know he’s bisexual and I’ve always been straight but every time i see a picture of him with his long hair, I get butterflies… I’m really concerned for him on more than a friendship level, a very emotional level. Heck I love him.

He lives in sweden and i’m stuck in dumb ole texas (&gt;_&lt;) but I’m saving up to visit him one day…. If he doesn’t do anything too rash. I don’t know what to say or do, I love him and I don’t want him to hurt himself but I’m scared he will reject me and I’ll say something that will trigger him to do more self harm?????

"Holding the bottle. Suicide is not selfish.I feel that a lot of the negative connotation towards suicide is those left behind. But they don't understand the suffering. I have a family who loves me, but they don't know or understand how hard each day is for me. Rather, they think I need to snap out of this funk. But it isn't that. I've suffered from deprsesion for years. Unfortunately I recently lost my medical insurance so I can't even receive any help. And when I had insurance I did, and none of it helped. I'm alone, I can't get over a breakup from almost 2 years ago, I can't find any sort of happiness. I lost my job and the wealth I built up, I was successful and was earning a lot of money, had fancy cars, clothes, ect. Now I struggle to figure out where my next meal will come. I realize it is possible to recover from this illness but I think I am in too deep. I just wish there could be more awareness to the survivors that this is the best thing for us, that our suffering is over and we can finally find solace. I've had many failed attempts that I should have never survived based on meds I OD'd on and such. Hopefully tonight that wont be the case. ",suicidal,high

I am currently seeking treatment for mental health. My mental health sometimes interferes with my work. I don't have a family history of mental health issues. I would not seek help for mental health issues. There might be negative consequences for discussing mental health issues. Additional thoughts: I burnt out this year. I worked too much had too much pressure on myself from being the sole developer on a delayed project that seemed to grow in size with each week it was delayed by and worried about money a lot.I became depressed and anxious and had trouble eating sleeping and generally being myself. As my depression worsened I was regularly late for work couldn't perform as well as I should and became irritable with my colleagues.My employers response after a while was to send me private messages complaining about my lateness which only worsened the situation. I was prescribed 3 weeks off work by my doctor which my employer agreed to only to come back after to find I had been on 'statutory pay' which was roughly half of what I was expecting and was not enough to cover my rent bills AND food. This made me worse and sent me into another depression until I eventually admitted defeat gave up working and left the company. It took me months to recover and I'm now left (over 6 months after this all started) recovering from the fallout I created leaving employment with hardly any money to my name.I had previously been told by my employer that I was too young to burn out and (stupidly) trusted them. I did not feel comfortable discussing my problems with my employer because each time I was met with an attitude that I had to get myself together and ultimately given the amount of employees before me who had left the company by being fired after an altercation with the employer left me with no option but to hide it from them so I too wouldn't be fired.,depression,medium

Sorry for my bad english. I just can't take it anymore, first of all some days ago i tried to kill myself but it didn't go well, i don't have many friends, i can't always ask my mom to help me because she feels bad when i tell her how i always feel bad, she and my gf are the only one who knows about my suicide attemp, my gf got super upset and i understand her, after all, its all my fault, i have been screaming to her that i seriously need help but she says:
""Well, you are always sad anyway"" and i feel way worse, i really don't know what to do, i feel so bad, everything feels worse and i have been thinking about trying to kill myself again, by hanging myself but the painless way (breaking my neck), or going to the train station and throw myself to the rails. I just want to stop feeling this horrible sensation, this loneliness, i want to stop thinking.

Just now i talked to my gf, she said she will listen me and that she said those things yesterday b/c she was angry, but now she just told me:

""are you going to continue with that""
- This is why i told you that it was bad to express myself
""i think so""

What the actual fuck, does she really even care for me?

"‘Nostalgia’ - please read That feeling. The one when something sparks a thought. A rememberance of a past memory. Maybe in your childhood. Maybe feelings of pure bliss. Running through fields of grass. The feeling of summer. The heat from the sun in your skin. The smells. The pleasant sensory overload. You feel that feeling. Warm and fuzzy. Like your vibrating. Memories of pure happiness. And then you zoom out. Back to your life now. You become sad. Life was so much better back then. You miss it. You miss everything. Everything was so simple. And good. You were much happier. You want to live in that time forever and ever. But time flies. And 50 years from now you’ll have this same occurrence. Thinking about these times. How they were so much better. Filled with joy. Maybe friends. Family. And now your all old. Parents are gone. Life is boring. It’s grey. You don’t do much. All you’re left with is memories. You wonder where the time has gone. Did it really fly by that quick. It couldn’t have. I can’t be think old already. I’m almost at my end. I had a lot more stuff I wanted to do. I never did this or that. Man I miss those times. Those memories. I wish I spent every living second to the fullest that I could. I shouldn’t of cared about money. Or school. Because none of that matters now. On my death bed. All I’m left with are memories. Positive and negative. I wish I lived more. Traveled the world on foot. Met thousands of people. Had so many amazing friends. Amazing experiences. Fell in love over and over again. I wish I lived. It’s best to live your life. Break your addictions. Get rid of your phone. Save up. Downgrade to a flip phone. Switch your SIM cards. Find a cool group fo friends. Get closer. Encourage them to do the same. And keep going. Keep living. Have fun. Be alive. Be real. Be in the moment. Because one day that’s all you’ll have. Memories of what you did now. Did you really think you’ll be satisfied with laying in your bed all day on your phone. Do you really think you wouldn’t want to just go back and knock some sense into your younger self. Live life. Remember when you were young and wanted to grow up so bad because of all the freedom it would give you. Everyone told you no. Slow down. You want to cherish these times. You didn’t believe them. You had no perspective. You grew up anyways. And now. Now you realize they were right. Those were the best times. I’m grown up now. I wish I lived more during them. I wish I lived in the moment. Embraced being a child. Well that’s how it is now. Your current reality and everything you’re doing at this exact moment is playing like a movie in your future selfs mind. What do you think they would say about what you’re doing right now? Please. Live your life. Throw away your phone. Band up with some friends and LIVE. Truly live. Because life is short. Very short. And once you’re on your deathbed. The truly most valuable things in the world will be your positive memories and experiences. So make the old you happy. Make them feel okay with their life. Make them feel consent. Like they truly lived. And didn’t waste it. And weren’t just wishing for more time. Shift your perspective for a moment. Ask yourself.

I am currently seeking treatment for mental health. My mental health sometimes interferes with my work. I have a family history of mental health issues. I'm not sure if I would seek help for mental health issues. I feel there would be negative consequences for discussing mental health issues. Additional thoughts: The main reason for the openness answers are because of an experience with my last employer. I felt I could trust my direct supervisor so I divulged information. It ended up spreading to more supervisors and eventually my coworkers. Supers highly suggested treatment but rushed things that shouldn't have been rushed and I ended up being incorrectly treated in a psych ward and mentally scarred from the issue. I lost most of my desire to program due to the experience not to mention thousands of dollars I lost - lost work time vacation time they used for treatment time doctors expenses etc. I have major depressive disorder high anxiety and mild agoraphobia. After seeing what treatment has to offer I will likely not seek it again and continue as is. (Long story short.),depression,medium

I hate being here, I hate being alive. I deserve to die and leave myself desecrated. I’ll never bring joy because I’m not wired right. I have BPD and I think that’s causing this but at the same time, this cycle continues again and a-fucking-gain. I’m miserable and sad. I feel angry for still being here, I want to feel my neck break I want to feel myself suffer and gasp for life and to not have that option anymore.

"how do i help someone who considers suicide all the 
time and is at tipping point?a person i know has been considering suicide for years and i want to help them. i've told them i'll always do whatever i can to help them if they want to do it even if it just means giving them somewhere to stay away from their real life and escape their problems, but they seem adamant that they have no reason to live. is there anything i can do or is it just hoping they never actually do it? they say the only reason they dont do it because they dont want to upset their mother but they dont feel like living any more. im concered all itll take is one thing to happen and theyll do it.

"I guess I'll do one too.Hi, new to the sub. I'm not really on ""the verge"" of killing myself, but I haven't got many reasons not to. I'm 19 btw. In college. I had a good childhood by most of your standards, I mean my parents seperated but both love me very much. I also don't have any financial issues and I'm not ugly to the point of people making fun of me for it, though I could lose some weight. 

So, all seems good right? Well, I just feel like pain, and suffering, are guarantees, and happiness is just a phase (like the song). When I was younger, I always dreamed of exploring new lands and finding new life, that was my passion. I'd love to go to the Amazon or something similar some day just to explore some areas. But I feel like I was born at the worst possible time for me. I want to explore, but was born at a time too late to explore new lands, and too early to explore the universe. I'm stuck with living in a world of cities and suburbs and pollution and morons. I'm also atheist if that's relevant, which I think it is because everyone in my family is a christian, not hardcore or anything, but I just can't look at religious people and see them as intellegent. (I don't want to start a religion war, it's just my opinion!). 

 So I just feel like there isn't viable opportunity for me to actually pursue the very limited things I actually find interesting. I live in the midwest in a regular city, so when I go outside, 3/4 times of the year i'm too cold, and the environment is shitty there's nothing interesting because everything is property. I always wanted to just run away to a tropical island and live off the land, but found that being alone for more than a week I start going a little insane. 

I just feel like the majority of my days now, are looking to the end of them excited for it to be OVER. If most of my time is stressful, I just kind of feel like suicide might be nice even though I don't believe in any afterlife. I always thought people who wanted to off themselves were weak and bad people for hurting those who loved them. That's the big reason I don't do it, because of what it would do to my family. So I probably never will. But I feel like i'm about to waste another 4 years of my life in college, to end up getting a job for a few years till we are too overpopulated and polluted to survive and then i'll look back and see life as a waste of time.

"I remember this haunting sceneThis was when I was in elementary school. On a random school day in like grade 5 I can still remember when my mom was making breakfast I went downstairs to our basement to check on our cat and for some reason I decided to do it in the dark. When I got in room where she is normally kept I saw her lying in between some pipes dead and alone, and I decided to poke her with a pole. (She was 18 btw) I left and continued the day like a normal being.

I bawled my eyes out remembering it again I want to join her as well. About 10 more years minimum and I’m out of this shit world. Thinking about it maybe it was a sign because now I’m dealing with Depression, Anxiety, Insomnia, OCD, Stress, Low blood sugar, eye problems, back problems, and another disorder that makes me a sociopath.

"i wanna post this I don't know any interesting titleThis is my first ever post on reddit. I am 19,F , soon turning 20. I don't feel good rn. So many things going inside my head... It's chaotic. Too many suicidal thoughts.. it's getting tougher day by day. 
Everything sucks literally everything. I tried too hard to work on my insecurities, but I see no difference. 
I am a brown skinned girl, living in India. Sometimes I feel cursed. I have been getting racist remarks since the day I was born. It made me really insecure and till date, even if someone genuinely compliments me.. I still feel insecure and feel the person is making fun of me. Worst part, even my parents(whom I love the most) are 'fair skin is beautiful' believer. I feel so shit. My younger sister is of fairer complexion and I always get compared to her. 
I still remember, when she was in kindergarten and I was jn 3rd grade, a teacher taunted me by saying how can she be my sister as she is fair and beautiful. Till date it hurts like hell. 
Talking about my parents, they never asked me how I feel or what are my interests... it's always how much have you scored.. Why did you not get into medical school.. Why are you mad at us..etc etc. It's not like I never tried telling them how I feel or anything but they never paid any attention. Never. They are not the worst. I love them. They are nice humans but I wish they cared about my mental health or at least asked me about my day. 
When I was 13/12 years (I don't remember exact age), my own grandfather sexually molested me. No one in my family knows this. And I don't think I will ever have the courage to speak about this matter. I am traumatized. I feel uncomfortable around every male now. No matter how much they mean to me. 
I have eating disorder too. When I was in 8th grade I stared gaining some weight but then my dad said that I should eat less, work out more. Even my classmates, neighbors, people whom I know stared commenting on my body. I swear I was never insecure about my body but from that time till today I fear putting on weight again. I eat less, sometimes don't eat... Work out alot even if my body aches. I hate it. But I can't stop. 
I'm 5'1 ish and my sister is slightly taller than me. People/my parents even comments on that too. I mean ok now I'm insecure about my height too thanks. 
Again, during childhood my mom did something (i don't wanna talk about that) and that's where almost all my trauma started. It's a very sensitive topic and I have never discussed this with anyone. 
Again my friends are toxic. Makes me feel bad about my skin/place/almost everything. But I don't wanna be lonely too. I fear that. I mean I love being alone but hate being lonely. 
I am kind of an introvert too so it's very difficult for me to make friends. 
My past relationships are a mess too. 
There are alot of more things going on but ngl I feel good writing this.",suicidal,high
"I broke up with my gf, now feeling awful and hating myself. Also have abusive parents. Everything is falling apart. I don't believe in my future.I am 26yo male from small city in Southern Kazakhstan. I work in a bank as a low level manager, reasonably well-paid job in our country. I am a convinced atheist. I was raised by my grandma(80yo) and grandpa(82yo), cause my parents divorced, then my father hang himself(I was 2yo), the day when court hearing happened.  Then, my grandpa convinced my mom that she can't afford a child and he can adopt me. My mom agreed, then married another man and I've seen her only one time in 24 years. I don't have any feelings for her.

My grandma and grandpa hate each other, on top of all. Grandpa always curses her, yells at her, etc. Grandma sometimes answers back, conflict escalates, grandma calls her sons, they try to make peace, always fail, take her to their home, after like a week, grandpa calls his son to get her home. Nobody is apologizing for anything. I have never seen my grandpa apologize for anything to anyone. Also, my grandpa has this victim manipulation, when he everyday says that he did everything to raise me(which is true) and other children and we can't care after him as much as he did. Also, he always blames me that I am not like other people's son. ""They did that, they're working in Korea, in Russia, in US and earning 5 times more than you earn"". When I say""okay, I can also go to Korea and earn as much"" he replies"" No, you can't. You will be lost there."" I have my own apartment in suburb, I can't even sleep there for one night. He will say"" You are not grateful, look at neighbor's son, he looks after him 24/7'. Of course, because he doesn't have a job. And everyday psychological abuse continues. It started when I was 10-11 he would start speaking when we were about to sleep, and talk for 4-5 hours, then we slept around 3-3,5 am. It's been 15 years already. He wants to control everything. Even when I am eating meal f.e. add garlic he says, I say I don't want to. He replies: ""Of course, you don't want to. When did you ever do something I told?"".
He even tells me to quit my job and work as a teacher, because I may go to jail if I mess up documents. Also, he has arthritis in his knees and can't walk. Doctor said that only way to treat it is surgery and knee replacement for prosthesis and doctor won't fo it because of risks to the heart.  Everyday for past 5 years he comes up with something from the TV, radio, magazines, etc. that will definitely treat his knee. From horses shit to snakes oil. And very expensive MLM stuff. 
We always eat three of us, and he always  reads aloud newspaper, articles that fits his views. F.e. on adultery, woman hatred, etc. We sit in silence, if we speak, he will tell all our mistakes(how I failed test to prestigious school in 7th grade, how I lost my ebook reader, how I lost my backpack with money, etc.) which we've been listening for years before sleep. But it's been 5 or 6 years since he stopped talking before sleep, when I moved to my own room with scandal, but moved. He has 5 sons, 3 daughters. First son doesn't recognize him as father, as he was himself his grandpas son(we have this weird tradition to give first child to parents), 2nd lives in another city and he comes once in 3-4 years and doesn't care(he moved out as soon as he married as 18yo), 3rd died early, 4th my father hang himself when I was two years old, 5 th is the only one who tries to care. Daughters have their husbands and their parents, and they physically can't visit us more than once per week. They all kind of know him, yet they pressure that It's my responsibility, since heritage will also be mine. They say how much will he live, wait couple years more, everything will be alright. 
So, this is my parents.


Yesterday I broke up with my gf(19yo), whom I loved very much. She's Muslim,very smart and pretty. We talked over phone and texted each other everyday over 3 weeks, everything was going great, then we decided to meet. It's very hard to get out of house in here for girls without permission. She lied something to her parents and we met. We dined and talked over two hours. I was very frank. I said everything about me. I said that I am an atheist, but I respect her beliefs.  
I told my gf everything she needs to know. Then, at the end of date, she said that she didn't feel we are meant for each other, and that she had another bf whom she dated over a year, but her mother was against that bf, but she can't forget her. Okay, we agreed that it's probably right and broke up. 

Now, I feel, that everything is meaningless. I should care after elders(80yo and 82yo). I need some help with them, I can't afford housewife. All of their sons (3) and daughters (3) are living on their own. Grandpa doesn't want to leave his house, no matter what. I want to marry someone I like, who will help me look after my elders, and I can't find anyone. Like 90% of girls here are very Muslim girls. Other 10% will not be approved by my family, and they probably have progressive views and won't f.e. shower my grandma, as they don't feel it's their responsibility. I can probably fake that I am a Muslim, but I would be disgusted with myself. I was very pressured when I studied at college, where everybody did Namaz, they would pressure me everyday about why I am not doing. I had many questions that nobody could answer, they said I shouldn't question belief. Honestly, I don't care If there's God or not.I just want to fucking live my life stressless and without any conflicts in comfort. 

All our relatives are pressuring me to get married asap. I don't know what to do. What to live for? I want to run from all of them, rent cheap apartment and play CSGO and chess all day long, read books,  watch Twitch streams and jav porn for next 30 years. I just don't see any solution, and I don't have anyone to talk to. I have one friend, he says I should focus on work, it will help. Nobody understands me. My country, Kazakhstan, has one the highest suicide rates, like top3, yet we don't have single hotline not from country, not from international communities. I have good health and enough money, this house (around 70k$ worth) and my own apartment (20k$ worth), yet I want to fucking end it all. I kind of understand my father now.",suicidal,high

"This one goes out to the fellas So I have severe body dysmorphia and when I was 15 I was about 226lbs at 5’10 and I went full anorexic and began not eating for days at a time and working out up to 3 times a day. After 4 months I was 167 at 6’1. You would think I would be overjoyed with my insane progress plus growing 3 inches in 4 months while eating almost nothing makes no sense. Instead I hated everything. I had some extra skin and I would cut it with a razor blade and say it was a carving accident. I was ingesting triple the testosterone booster they give to transgender men. I was just in constant mental and physical pain. 

For the last year I’ve just been taking testosterone booster and doing home workouts because of COVID. The isolation didn’t help the problem. My entire mindset was “by the time I go back to in person school I’ll be a Greek god”. 

2 days ago I realized I’m not a Greek god, and I almost logged out for good. I’m really glad I didn’t. 

Guys just try and live healthy. Diet and exercise, don’t starve yourself and workout until you collapse.

"Can't come up with a title.I have a roof over me. Never had to go hungry my entire life. I even got though uni; albeit I had to go though an extra year because I failed a few subjects, barely scraping though at the end too. I have a decent job for my age. I have enough money to spend on tech which should be keeping me entertained. Basically, I'm not crazy rich, but I can afford to live an above average lifestyle.

I should be happy or at least contented with my life, but I'm neither. I sure that many people wish that they could be in my shoes. But I think of suicide almost every night before I go to bed, wishing I would not wake up the next morning.

I think can do most things decently, but I have never really exceled in anything. Never really put effort into anything; never had the motivation to. I just coasted through life all this while, which is the reason why I flunked those few subjects in uni and had to retake them. Which is also one of the reason why I think I suck at this job right now.

This job I have right now, I don't think I'm qualified for it. Any task I'm given, I either take a bloody long time to complete it, or I'm just unable to complete it. I'm surprised I'm still not laid off yet; although I won't be surprised if they did once my probation is over. The only reason I got this job is because I went through my mom's connections. Wouldn't have gotten this job without her. And I have my reasons to think so.

A little back story before I got this job. I held another job before this for about two years. I felt miserable after the first month onwards. Decided to ghost everyone I knew, hoping that it would encourage me to off myself quicker. One day, I just quit my job. No warning. Pretty sure my employer hated me for that. Since then, I was jobless for two years, being a useless fuck at home. Relied on my parents and my savings after I quit. My current employer is aware about the two year hiatus. See why I think I don't deserve this job?

I'm an irresponsible person who should not be alive under normal circumstances. How nice would it be if I could just walk into a hospital, get euthanized and donate my organs to someone who actually deserves it more.

Now, since I have a job, I have the money to spend on liquor again. Been drinking myself to sleep every night. Going through a bottle of whiskey or gin every week; and showing no signs of slowing down.

I don't know where I'm going with this post. Just looking for somewhere to vent I guess. Noticed that my writing isn't really well constructed here. Hopefully, my paragraphing would help make the reading less annoying. And if you have read this far, thanks for reading and sorry for wasting your time.",suicidal,high
"Just wanna not be aliveOk ill try and keep this short, and also idk where this is headed. But I've had anxiety through the roof for a few years now, and super depression since my senior year of high school. Like it's gotten so bad that I've attempted but never follow through because the thought of being dead terrifies me. But I hate being alive, nothing good comes from what I do. I literally fuck everything up, if there's a way to fuck it up. I'll do it. I'm practically failing out of college because I hate this major, I'm trying to switch but it might be too late. I'm sick of how I am as a person talking behind other people's back about other people. I'm sick of being alive, it's gotten to the point where I would rather sleep than be awake. If anyone reads this, thanks for the taking the time to do so. I'm most likely not going to do it because I'm to afraid, I just had to get this off my chest. I feel like people would think I was crazy if I told them this in person",suicidal,high

"What the hellI skipped the suicide hotline this morning because they're apparently staffed by people who make it worse, not better, and jumped the line to talk to the mental health ER that I can get to in my zip code. They're sort of notoriously terrible for LGBTQ people but they're the one I can get to, so why the hell not?

Before I could even get to my gender/sexuality (or mental health) concerns, the woman asked me for insurance and state ID (specifically for the state where I currently reside). When I said I don't have either, that I moved states when my husband passed, she told me I could get evaluated at the hospital because the county pays for it, but I could not get treatment, medication, in patient or out patient services, or see any medical staff outside the evaluation. 

I said I didn't want an evaluation because I already know that I am rampantly suicidal and a dangerous to myself and have already attempted once in the past 24 hours. I'm not so unwell that I don't know that. 

So... Apparently in the US, our mental health system is way shittier than I thought it was.",suicidal,high

Instead she bailed, and encouraged my kids to stop talking to me.

I want to punish my gossipy neighbors for spreading rumors about me.  Let them be the eons who now have to spend years consoling my dad over this, and let them know why.

"Getting help can't fix meI don't know where to start. I am 20 years old and I'm stuck in a cycle that keeps repeating itself. It has started snowing and it reminds me of the time I was in a very, very dark place about 3 years ago. I somehow kept myself alive during the winter of 2010, and I've never been the same since. 

When I was about 8-9 years old, I was forced into sex by some older kids, and to be honest, I didn't think anything of it. I actually liked it. 
This went on til I was about 14 years old. All my friends were growing up, getting girlfriends, but I wasn't. At first I thought I might be gay, but as I grew older I started to realize that I was becoming what I feared most as a child, a pedophile. High school was really difficult for me because I wasn't like others. I had a great group of friends, everyone liked me because I was nice to everybody, but deep down I was a mess. I started spiraling out of control since then.

 I like to consider myself a giving person. The feeling of making someone happy is all I have. I will never have someone to really love and care for, ever! I don't really spend time trying to figure out why I became ""this"" person. genetic accident? or maybe its just a normal part of being human. I look at myself in the mirror and I am disgusted. I still can't believe this happened to me. I ask myself why everyday, and I just can't take it anymore. The pain I feel is excruciating and mind altering. I don't want to live as a ""fake"". i am tired of having this burden on my shoulders. I am tired of having these thoughts.

Why even try? There is no magic pill that can fix me, there is no psychiatrist that can help me. Why me? I didn't choose this, I hate it, I absolutely hate it. I was unwillingly brought into this world that doesn't accept me. And no matter what anyone has to say about it, you just don't know what its like.

Well, what can I say. I don't qualify to be a productive citizen of this planet. They say ""Live to Love"", and I need to ""love to live"". And if I can't have that, then I'd rather not be here. 

Good luck with everything you guys, please don't let this world get even more shittier than it already is, I'll be watching from above! :)

"I don’t think I’ll get to graduateI’m at uni at the moment and my mental health has created endless and repetitive cycles of self destruction and I’m getting none of my work done. I had three essays due at the start of January, none of which ever got handed in and I have a new deadline which I have also missed. Every day that goes by the mountain of work I have to do creates such intense stress and anxiety it makes me physically ill (I’ve had a mix of various colds/abdominal pains/migraines). I skip class because I’m stressed but that only makes it worse. 

I can’t bring myself to admit to others how much I’m struggling and I feel backed into a corner of self loathing and self doubt, fear eating me up from the inside and sometimes when I lie in bed spending another evening completely isolated all I can think about is dying. I don’t know what to do. I can’t tell my partner this, there’s too much on his mind, too much stress in his life to let him worry about me but I know my behaviour makes him unhappy and he keeps asking such pervasive questions of me and I feel like I have no outlet or anyone to hear me.

"why do I need to suffer more than other people for having my suicidal tendencies and depression taken seriously?It has been over 2 years I am dealing with suicidal thoughts but it certainly feels more than that. I have no one to vent to or maybe I don't feel comfortable venting to anyone that's why I'm  stuck by myself with this pain. No matter how hard I try seeking help all I get told is to pray and to look at other people suffering more than me. It often just makes me feel way worse and I have no way of expressing it. I cry my eyes out and contemplate about ending it every single day. Sometimes I just close my eyes and force myself to sleep to get rid of this feeling but it's always the same. I don't like being compared, I really want to be taken seriously and get some validation. I have always tried to validate and comfort others going out of my way but I hardly find anyone being there for me. Mostly all I have seen is my friends calling me out for being weak and annoying.

I tried killing myself that day but the knot got loose and I fell. Till this date, when I have anxiety attacks all I get is kicked away and people justifying themselves about my situations that they had helped me before.

"I'm almost done with itSome words about me :
I'm 22 yo male from Poland, depressed since I can't remember and social at least since I was 13 yo. First time I tasted a beer when I was around 8, first cigarette at 10, first try with amphetamines and cocaine at the age of 13, when I was 14 I got sexually assaulted by old male stranger and I was too afraid to tell anyone and since I was 16 I keep smoking and whenever I have access to hard drugs I'll do anything to get them and keep myself from sobering. A couple of time i didn't sleep for like a week straight. Since I was 7 or 8 I think till I was 16 I saw my parents every day drunk and I've had to take care for myself, them and animals (we lived on a small farm). It got better only because I told them that if they won't change a soon as I'll be 18 yo I'll move out to another country and forget about them. I have only 1 sister 3 years older than me who used to be a very good sister to me but when she became a teen she just forgot about me. She becase rebel and I've had to be the ""Good child"" who's always there, always helpful, happy, well mannered etc. I didn't really have a friend till I was 16 and changed school and before that I was bullied by everyone, everyday and I've had nobody to help me out. When I found my first friend at 16 yo I was sure - I'm gay and I have to hide it from everyone. I just became more depressed and suicidal because of it. Skipping a couple of years my friend broker my heart many time without knowing I'm gay, I moved out to another country and became more lonely, got in debt in bank, came out to couple of my friends that I'm gay, almost tried to kill myself a couple of times and abused hard drugs. I've been trying to find myself a boyfriend because I don't care anymore what others will think but I keep having bad luck.

"Suicide due to my situationI want to start this by saying this is no way for attention, I just can't talk about this in my situation because I'd be put on literal suicide watch hence why i'm talking about this here.

I've been in the us army for a good amount of timing and am currently getting discharged and I've never felt like killing myself more than i have right now. The embarrassment of being chaptered out even if it's honorable hurts me a lot. I could lie to people about why but the fact was i suck at running no matter how much i tried i would always struggle and trained enough to where it actually made my run time a lot worse. The biggest reason i'm considering suicide is because my mindset is im getting chaptered because im a failure. I've been told that i should not beat myself up about this and i have a good head on my shoulders. But it's so hard to keep lying to myself. When i get my ""honorable"" discharge I want to kill myself but I'd also hurt my girlfriend i've known for 6 years now. she has known i am very self destructive but she also knows i want to always be there for her even though our locations and work schedules make it so we have little free time to talk to each other.

"I don't know if i should write thisI can't feel happy. I've been in depression for almost a year and I can't get out of it.

Whenever i do something I like to ask myself ""Why do i do this ?""

Why do i need to go to school ? To get a good job.

Why do i need to get a good job ? To earn money.

Why do i need to earn money ? To buy what i need.

Why do i need to buy what I need ? So I can go to the job.

And the vicious cycle began.

It's just feel pointless, to the point, that I feel like living is worthless.

&amp;#x200B;

Whenever I get good grades in school my mum goes ""I'm proud of you"" and whenever I get bad grades in school my mum goes ""I'm taking away your phone and laptop""

Why does it matter so much, that I get some stupid number on a worthless test ?

Why am I considered to be a bad student, when I can't learn the FUCKING LITERATURE ? Even when I get good grades at every other subjects ?

&amp;#x200B;

I'm just done with everything. But mostly with myself.

I'm trapped in my mind, and i can't escape even when the cell is open.

I took part in a online course where I learned about the art of sales. I learnt it because I wanted to get out of school.

But guess what ? I took zero action, and isolated myself, so noone could even help me.

&amp;#x200B;

I can't live with myself, I'm just not wothy for living.

I agree with the ""Operate on a principal of ""Help those who help themself"""", and I can't even help myself, not even a bit.

So what's the point of livining if i can't help myself.

"I'm glad I thought about my family.I've been struggling with depression and anxiety for a very long time. I hit rock bottom a month ago, when I started to plan out my suicide. I was going to go a park, take a bunch of pills, and call the cops so a stranger nor my family would find me.

 thought up to the end how it would effect my family. I was crying in the tub overcome with stress from my anxiety, and emptiness from my depression when I planned it.


I realized I couldn't handle my anxiety. I'm was sick of dealing with it. I was writing out my suicide note, when I realized I needed help. I was crying after I wrote my apologies to my family.

I have kept my depression so well hidden, no body knows anything is wrong. My family doesn't know how close I was to ending my life. I smile and laugh, try to make them happy all while I am here.

"I fully don’t know what makes me want to kill myself more: school or home?I’m still in high school, and these have been the worst years of my life. At school I have no friends, and there’s just a very strong mean girl/bully culture that I can’t stand (it’s an all girls). Obviously I’ve tried making friends, but none of the friendships have been that genuine.

At home I feel like I have no one to talk to and I can’t truly express myself because my family is very judgemental, they don’t trust me, and they’re just not accepting of a lot of things. I also have no one to talk to — because every time I tell them about my real emotions they just invalidate them, and say I’m over exaggerating. I’m also the only girl and I’m the youngest, and I strongly feel that they don’t respect me and look down on me because of that. The arguments always “well you’re only sixteen, you’re being dramatic” or “I’m sure it’s not that bad” or “you’re the reason you’re sad”

I have so many emotions, but no one to talk to them about and it makes me feel so lonely. A lot of the time I feel like: maybe I am being over dramatic, like I’m just too sensitive and I should just get over myself. But it’s getting so hard to see the silver lining in situations when both my home and my school life make me sad. I always can’t help but think — what if I end it all? A lot of the times it feels like no one would care anyways, and it would be better because I’m just a burden.

"Been feeling sad for about 2 years now.Hello there, I  guess I can start with an introduction. I'm 15, just starting my second year in high school. (I know a kid like me shouldn't have much to complain about, but everyone has some problems right?) Most of my years when I was a kid I was that one kid who just stayed home playing single-player video games all by himself and had maybe one or two friends. At the time I didn't really care because I was just a small kid. As the years went on I noticed I was the kind of kid nobody cares about or who would just compare themselves to me just for a good laugh. Eventually I started being more social, and making more friends. I was the friend you would talk to at school, but you would never hang out with them. I didn't care though. I was so happy, I hardly had friends and the few people who were my friends were mean to me. Even if I only talked to them in school at lunch or between classes, I was filled with joy for the sake that people enjoyed talking to me! I starting being even more social and talking to many people and they were nice to me, it was a whole new world I never knew, and before I knew it I started hanging out with those friends. I was so happy, and I even enjoyed talking to other people who were sad. It made me happy seeing other people happy! Eventually I calmed down a bit and it felt normal having these friends, but there was nothing to be sad about. One day out of nowhere I just felt like it was hard to talk to make, I couldn't make eye contact and it was hard to help other people with their problems. I didn't know what was going on, but I started becoming very sad. I noticed more and more that it was hard to talk to anyone who wasn't my close friend. From there on I started picking back up bad habits like constantly keeping my hood on at all times to avoid attention from people. Then it started escalating really fast. It was hard to walk around other people, I felt like they were watching me and I sometimes forgot how to walk properly. (I know it sounds stupid, but I'm serious) Whenever I heard someone laugh around me I felt as if they were laughing at me, I didn't even like people bumping into me or touching me. I started hating everyone, I felt like I was going crazy. I someone bumped into me I thought in my head ""Bump into me again, and I will make sure you die slowly."" Whenever I saw people happy it made me angry for some reason. And I questioned the things I was saying and I didn't know what to think anymore. The only times I truly laugh now is when I am around my close friends. Sometimes when I look at them I forget that they are my friends because I always look back at the times when nobody liked me. Not only was I sad I started becoming suicidal. I spent all day in class thinking about how I could use the equipment in the class to kill myself and I daydreamed about if I was different in a better way. I now I notice people are treating me like some person who just moved into the school from a foreign country and talk to me like I can't even speak English. On my 14th birthday my dad took me out to go shoot a gun for the first time, and I thought to myself it was my golden opportunity to kill myself. Of course i couldn't do it because they didn't keep their eye on me and I felt as if they would stop me and it wouldn't go well after that. After that I kept poking myself with knives to see how much force it would take to actually have the blade dig in my skin. I use to try my best to be socially active whenever I got the chance. Now all I do is spend my time sitting in my basement watching anime or sitting down looking at the floor with my hood up. (I believe that my hood keeps me safe, as dumb as it sounds) I feel like if I lose my friends I will lose everything. They are honestly the only people who can make me happy. Please Reddit can you help? My situation may not seem like much, but I feel so sad every day and I don't want my friends to worry about me.

"Had a nightmare about my dead mother, I just want out of this existence In 2007 when I was 21 I lost my mother. We had a very close mother-daughter relationship and were best friends. She died suddenly from an unexpected infection in hospital after an operation for cancer. It happened right in front of me. The sweet, kind, darling, oh-so-huggable woman who reared me went limp. Her eyes rolled back and her tongue was hanging out. Red frothy stuff started to pour from her nostril. I sat there for hours on a chair with my knees up, pressing my face into the pillow I was hugging.

I keep having dreams where she comes back from the dead to be with me, and I tell her much I love her and try and do everything to make her stay, but at the end of the dream there's nothing I can do to stop her dying all over again. Last night's rendition of this was particularly vivid and has left me feeling wrecked ever since.

I also lost my wonderful friends after that. I had to move back home to take responsibility for the house and my sick father, leaving all my beloved friends in another state on the other end of the country. We kept in touch via phone and MSN for a while, but you know how these things go.

I spent a year in complete isolation with only my non-conversational father for company before getting my journalism degree and going straight into the workforce. I guess a lot of people would envy my life- I own a car, a house, and earn decent money working in the highly-competitive media industry. 

However, I feel... isolated. Lonely. I miss that love and affection that only a mother can provide, I miss warm hugs from friends who were willing to go out on a limb for me. I have ""obligatory friends"" who I hang out with just to escape the confines of my house, but they're mostly wrapped up in their own lives and get weird if I'm sad or go in for a hug.

I am in a lot of pain. I have self-harmed in the past (lots of scars, used to bash my head against walls, punch my self, force myself to sit in freezing rain). I have been on anti-depressants in the past and have just ended up overdosing on them so my doctor says I shouldn't take them anymore because they make my suicidal urges more erratic. I can't afford therapy. 

Also, having a full time job means I have no ""me time"" to recover and makes me feel very trapped. I know working is something we all have to do, but I have regular freak outs about not being able to run away home or interstate when my depression and anxiety get too much.

I guess I am just in dire need of an exit, an escape. I'm such an emotional, huggy person who has been left completely love starved and trapped in the workforce. I need out.

I'm not much of a talker, just wanted someone to read this I guess.

I had to do this. I hope all of you prosper, and find peace in something. I know you guys can do it, I really do. Never get in over your head with mistakes. Don't fuck up. Put yourself out there. Be better than I was, at least.

"This is just a stupid rant about how much I pity myself and I’ve spent all day doing fucking nothing and I hate itI’m falling apart and have been for much too long. Yesterday I left work early for fear of having a mental breakdown and today I called in. 

Yesterday when I got home I bought cigarettes. Been trying to quit, but aren’t we all. It was nice outside so I just sat for a while. You know that depressed daze where all you can think about is how shit everything is and you just want to die? I just kept myself sitting there because I knew if I just sat there I wouldn’t be able to kill myself. I had a few hours until my bf got home and I’d be safe from myself, so until then I just sat. 

While I was sitting, a little boy who lives in my apartment building was outside with his mother. He was ecstatically playing and exploring. He couldn’t have been more than 2. He ran right up to me, oblivious to the horrible pain I was experiencing, and said, “Hi! How are you?” I could barely understand him, I don’t think he knows many words yet. How am I? Man I was dumbfounded. Finally I found words and broke out of my daze, at least for a second. “I’m good, how are you?” His mother smiled and told him to say, “I’m fine!” After that he ran off and she went after him. I’m glad I had sunglasses on because the encounter made me burst into tears. I was so jealous of that boy, he seemed so happy. I also felt terrible for him because one day his innocence will be ripped away and he will discover the horrible state of this world we’re living in. On top of it, hardly anyone knows I’m feeling this way, but he just seemed to know. I mean he obviously didn’t, but I swear his eyes were asking me if I was okay, if he could help me. It was so strange.

Today I called in and I feel terribly guilty. I’ve just been sitting around my apartment trying to convince myself that it’s okay to take a day to take care of myself. Except I’m not taking care of myself. I haven’t eaten, I’ve smoked far too many cigarettes, and I’m afraid to move for fear I’ll just go grab a razor blade and slit my wrists or take my belt out of the closet to hang myself. 

I know I need to go to work tomorrow. I need to stop taking sick days just to mope around. I’m going to try to go in early tomorrow to catch up. I’m going to try to stick it through, no leaving early, and I’m going to try not to cry at any point during the day. Holy fuck it’s gonna be hard though. I just feel like a worthless piece of shit. 

My bf will be home in a few hours again. I’m just gonna hug him and cry. I was hoping today would be a day to help me feel better, but I think I only made it worse. I keep thinking I’m going to get chewed out by my boss tomorrow, but that’s completely unrealistic, right? We have sick days so we can take them when we need them, and if I’m feeling this way I definitely needed one, right? I’m just trying to justify my dumbass fucking feelings and actions. I don’t know what to do anymore, I’m just a ball of anxiety and pain and I want it to stop.",suicidal,high

I haven't been in this dark a place for a long time. I did something really, really terrible and it's causing a huge rift in the family.

But knowing I'm going to be the cause of all that pain and hurt to that innocent person who I love and should have protected better, because of something I had no idea was going to blow up... I can't even face them.

I also haven't been to work since April. I was furloughed then, but officially laid off in August and there's no bites on anything I've applied to. Options are dwindling if I don't want a retail job. So I've got that, as well. A lazy piece of shit who ruined the family.

And then I'm trying so hard to impress my best friend who means a lot to me, who I'm really into, but the anti-dating-me signs are bombarding me recently, so that's taking a toll on my self esteem. I wish they'd just say, if they know I'm trying lol. I just wish I could tell them I am in love with them, and apologize for what I'm about to do. Leave a note for my family, apologizing for what I did (not for killing myself) and telling them I love them, and then somehow die.

I have no idea how to. I'm terrified. I'm terrified of if the afterlife I grew up being forced to believe is real (heaven). I'm terrified if I end up in hell. I just want to be in a coma or something. I don't know. I don't even know how I'd do it, and that's really, really tough on me. Because most of me really wants to.

"I don't know if I need help again or I just need safe companyI'm going to keep this brief because a full story of my life is probably an invite for doxing. The cliff notes version is I've had two major depressive episodes that lead to a suicide attempt. Once when I was around ten and always stopped myself mid act. And the second, which I will be focusing on, at age 21, after two years of military service in the uscg.

There were many reasons for why, but the biggest one is that I saw a dark future where the hazing never stopped, the preception others had would always lead to punishment on my end, and I would continue working for a group of people that would cover up anything right before my eyes. I actually know a guy with ptsd, but he can't report it because the incident was covered up. His exact words being ""we went out for a routine stop, guns loaded, and you were in the fleet so hopefully you can put two and two together."" Not only can I, but I was at the station when his boat was trying to dispose of some pappers. I could've done something, but didn't. I was looking out for myself just like everyone else was. And for good reason because the people around me would often accuse me of things I didn't do. They would also claim I was disrespect for answering a question on a board the same way I answered it to someone else the next day who did not think this. Then of course there's the hazing that sometimes involved hanging people from  a window naked or some other degradating task.

This all lead to me looking so miserable that I was sent to rehab and threatened to end myself before leaving. This lead to a long process to get medically retired. Now I'm waiting for covid19 to pass, looking for my other half, and not finding anything. I know it's early but I'm trying to make up for lost time. Leaving rehab, knowing I was going to the civilian world had me happy, scared but happier than I was. Now I'm alone and starting to slip into my old thoughts. 

I constantly fear that I'm taking advantage of a situation I have no right to. Nothing I went through is unique. Pain was normal, I just complained about it. I fear that I'll never redeem myself for standing by all those years. I took up online dating to find someone but all that's done is remind me that I'm ugly and unlovable. And I've been lying to my doctors about it, because I'm so close to being out I don't want to go back to rehab. Somehow reddit has been the nicest place for me to talk about my feelings. Even tho everytime i do I learn something I thought was normal is horrifying to someone else. Plus I still genuinely believe most people are cruel and evil, therefore it is best to trust no one.

Where do I even go for this? I don't want to die, I don't want to pay out of pocket, and I don't want care to put my life on hold.",suicidal,high

I have dealt with depression and thoughts of suicide before in my life. but this time is different. It has an undertone of tranquility and finality to it. Like internally I have acknowledged my suffering that I refused to acknowledge my whole life and that this will be the final time. 

My relationship with my family is good but it would definitely trigger alarm bells if I had a discussion of this depth with my sister or told her whatever happens I love her out of the blue. 

I just carried anger inside of me for so long when my brother committed suicide without really saying goodbye or any explanation. Maybe the same happened to him and he lost his chance to say goodbye. I don’t want the same to happen to me.",suicidal,high

"Does suicide make us weak or strong?I always argue in my head on if people who commit suicide and struggle with suicide ideation are strong or weak.

I just find it so dumb and ignorant how after a person commits suicide. People are like ""OH SUICIDE IS ONLY FOR THE WEAK."" blah blah blah. 

When in reality. I'm pretty sure whoever killed themselves convinced themselves that they WERE in fact weak. That's why they aren't here anymore. I feel like people who say things like that are trying to belittle the person who died of suicide. When in all actuality. The person who killed themselves would agree with them. 

But are people who commit suicide actually weak? I don't think so.

For those of us who struggle with suicide ideation. I don't believe we are weak. We are just perceived weak. Because no one on the outside looking in, are there with us. When we battle our internal/external demons. You know?

Like you have to be pretty fucking strong to not kill yourself. When you're crying. And have given yourself every reason in the world to end your life. And yet you still don't. However, no one sees those moments of huge courage, and bravery, and moments where we pull the strength to live out of thin fucking air. Even when we still don't feel strong at all. 

Like no one is there with us. When we've had a shitty day. And we're sitting down looking at those pills, we know one too many can kill us. Or when we've got a gun to our head. And somehow fight the urge to pull the trigger. Or those moments where we feel empty. And stare at the blades, we desperately just want to end it all with. Or the moments when we're in the shower. Breaking down because that's the only place where we get to lose our shit in peace. NO ONE IS THERE IN THOSE MOMENTS, EXCEPT US. 

And I just feel like the only difference between a person who died from suicide, and a person who is alive yet struggling not to commit suicide. Are the amount of moments in the dark they have. When no one is around us. Regardless though, I think we are all strong. Even though half of us (if not all), including myself don't always believe it. 

Just imagine how many people are too in denial that they are ""weak"" or going through something. Or too afraid to admit to them own selves that anything is wrong. I'd call a person who is in denial of their darkness ""weak"". Before I call a person who commits suicide ""weak"". 

Because it takes some huge strength to do the ""unthinkable"", or the thing that can't be ""reasoned"". Like killing one's own self. That goes against every natural instinct of the human mind. And I just don't think any ""weak"" person could accomplish such a task.",suicidal,high

"How should I make the first move to kiss my girlfriend. Dating for a month and a half I know this might sound like a typical highschool relationship ,but this is my first serious relationship and I want to do this right. I[17M] have been dating her [16F] for about a month and a half ,but we have been talking for over 5 months and just recently I confessed I liked her but we have discussed what we want in a relationship and we are both dating to marry and not just dating to date. I talked to her dad because she wanted that but I told her I wanted to aswell. Her dad [55M] said this is her first relationship and that he wants a healthy relationship and he said that I can put my arm around her and kiss her on the cheek and hold hands when I feel it’s right too. He asked though to come back to him when I want to kiss her on the mouth and he explained how that level of affection is a lot for a woman and she will get attached to it. Both our families live in a Christian home. I don’t know when the right time to kiss her is. I kissed her on the cheek one time when we hugged but I felt like she either didn’t realize it or she ignored it because she didn’t kiss back. I feel like i’m overthinking this relationship. I have kissed multiple girls in the past but this girl I don’t want to mess it up. I see a bright future with each other. I’m pretty sure she hasn’t been in a relationship before but she has talked alittle about the people she used to talk to in the past. We both hang out atleast once a week to grab some food or something small. We also don’t have too many places to go to kiss like outside wise because it’s getting a lot colder and I just don’t want to mess up our relationship. Should I goto the father first as a respectful thing to do or should I kiss her then ask her dad later down the road. This is new to me and I feel it’s weird I have to ask her dad for permission to kiss her. Also I feel like a month into dating is a good time to kiss but at the same time I hear about people kissing on their first date. What is y’all’s opinion on this?

Thank y’all 

TL;DR : How do I kiss my girlfriend for the first time , her dad told me to ask for his permission before I do so. Dating for a month and a half.",normal,low

"I'm scared because of the painHi , i'm 25 years old , and i belive weed and my ex gf cheating on me has fucked me up pretty bad , i've been under so much strees , and smoked so much weed i've fucked up my mind i could say . So last year, or two years ago i started having suicidal thoughts , and i stareted to think what would people say at my funeral , and how it would be with me dead . Sometimes i have psychosis episoded where i belive i'm dead and this is just a transit period , so my doctor prescrived OLANZAPINE TEVA 5MG a day , and that sucks , i want to do more with my life i told him , ive asked for antidepressants and got this shite in exchange , andi wont see him for another month , fucking idiot. 
Anyway , a few weeks ago , i said it's enougf , and i went on top of a building and decided it's going to be over now , but i stopped , first because i have an irrational fear of hights and second , i thought it's not going to be high enough to assure my death instead of being paralized in absurd pain , you know what i'm saying ? i don't know , i'm being strong here , and i send love and light to anyone who needs it , i'm trying to be strong so i can come out victorious with this crazy life at my back ,i'm being strong so that one day , i may laugh back and smile at these days , i'm being strong for all of US.",suicidal,high

"I asked my crush out So it all started Friday after school. She asked me saying if I could help her with the homework. I said yes not just because she is my crush but also because I like to help people. 

So we make our way over to her since my house is very messy and mom doesn’t like me having friends over when it’s messy. 

When we are there we go into her room and begin making homework. Before I know it it’s 7pm and I am hungry. So I say that it was fun and I will go home now so I can eat dinner. She says that I can eat with her since her parents will come home at 10 pm. I say that it would be nice and text my mom that I will be home 9:45pm. 

After we ate she says we should watch a movie and I agree. I watch the movie with a half eye and look at her for the rest of the time. I think she did the same thing. I begin to build up courage. 

I say that I love her and I ask her out on a date right when the movie ends. She says she loves me too and that she also wants me on a date. 

When it’s time to say goodbye and for me to leave. I say to her that it has been really fun staying here and I kiss her good night. She kisses back and says good night too

"I don't care if I'm loved if i can't feel it.What if someone kept feeding you sugar or something saying it was good and so sweet and glorious but you had a phsyical issue that negated your sense of tasting sweetness? You never tasted the good, just the grainy painful shit like sand that never nourished.

That's how I feel when people say ""don't go, you are loved.""

I know I'm loved.

I know its sugar.

I can't feel it.

I can't taste it.

The only reason I stay alive when people say ""you are loved"" is GUILT. Isn't that fucked up? You're guilting me into suffering more because that makes you happy somehow? Either find a reason that makes sense to my brain or turn your back and let me fucking die already!",suicidal,high
